## Procedures and Stacks
**A caller must:**  
Provide procedure "parameters"/"arguments"  
Put the arguments in a place where the procedure can access
them  
Transfer control to the procedure  
Jump to the procedure  

**A callee must:**  
Acquire the resources needed to perform the function  
Perform the function  
Place results in a place where the Caller can find them  
Return control back to the Caller  

**A (partial) solution for this is to allocate registers for 
these specific functions**  

### Procedure Linkage and Stack Frames
**CONVENTIONS:**  
Use a register for the Stack Pointer (`$sp = $29`)  
Stack grows DOWN as you push to it  
`$sp` points to the top *used* location  
Stack placed away from the program and its data (waaaaay up
high)  

### SP Functions
**Allocate k:** reserve k WORDS of stack  
`Reg[SP] = Reg[SP] - 4*k`  

**Deallocate k:** release k WORDS of stack  
`Reg[SP] = Reg[SP] + 4*k`  

**PUSH rx:** push Reg[x] onto stack  
`Reg[SP] = Reg[SP] - 4`  
`Mem[Reg[SP]] = Reg[x]`  

**POP rx:** pop the value on the top of the stack into
Reg[x]  
`Reg[x] = Mem[Reg[SP]]`  
`Reg[SP] = Reg[SP] + 4`  

`$30 = $fp (frame pointer) => points to the start of the callee's activation record on the stack (top of the current stack frame)`  
`$29 = $sp (stack pointer) => points to the top of the stack (lowest memory address of stack)`
