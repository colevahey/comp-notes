## Finite Automata
### Deterministic Finite Automaton
`M = (K, E, d, s, F)`  
```
K = states
E = possible state changes
d = outcome of state change, given state and change 
s = optimal state
F = conclusion of state changes
```
```
K = sad and poor, sad and rich, happy and poor, happy and rich
E = Make money, spend money, get a compliment, receive an insult
d(sp, mm) = sr; d(sp, sm) = sp; d(sp, gc) = hp; d(sp, ri) = sp
d(hp, mm) = hr; d(hp, sm) = hp; d(hp, gc) = hp; d(hp, ri) = sp
d(sr, mm) = sr; d(sr, sm) = sp; d(sr, gc) = hr; d(sr, ri) = sr
d(hr, mm) = hr; d(hr, sm) = hp; d(hr, gc) = hr; d(hr, ri) = sr
```
Steps for designing a finite automaton  
1. Divide all strings into a finite number of equivalent
   subsets  
2. Choose a state for each subset  
3. Put arrows between the states corresponding to the
   subsets  
4. The start set is the subset containing the empty string  
5. The accepting states are the subsets that are in L
