## Class 2
### Pigeonhole Principle
With a directed graph where every vertex has one arrow,
there must exist a cycle  
This is because eventually, one vertex must point to another
vertex, because there are as many edges as there are
vertexes  
If there was one less edge than vertexes, it would be
possible to have no cycles  

## Set Theory
### Inference Rules for Sets
 - `{a} subsetof {a, b}` TRUE  
 - `{a} elementof {a, b}` FALSE  
 - `{{a}, {b, c}} = {{c, b, c}, {a}}` TRUE  

### Alphabets   
 - Finite set of symbols
 - String *abbaca*  
 - Empty string is epsilon
 - Concatenation *aba ◯ bac = ababac*  
 - Substring *bc* and *abcaac*  
 - How many substrings are there of string of length n?
   `n(n+1) / 2`  
 - suffix = end of word
 - prefix = beginning of word
 - `w^i` is `i` repeated `w`s
 - `(abc)^R = cba`
 - IF `E` is an alphabet then `E*` is all strings over that
   alphabet  

Any set of strings over an alphabet is called a **language**  

### Languages
 - Operations on languages: L1 + L2 => L3  
 - Most languages are *unknowable*  
 - Complement of the language - Set of strings not contained
   in the language but contained in the universal language  
 - Concatenation of two languages - `{a,b,c} ◯ {b, c, d}
   = {ab, ac, ad, bb, bc, bd, cb, cc, cd}`  
 - Kleene Star: If `L` is a language then `L*`, the *Kleene
   star* of L, is `{w1, w2, ... wk : k >= 0, wi elementof
   L all i}` also written `{}
   U L U L ◯ L U L ◯ L ◯ L U L ◯ L ◯ L ◯ L U ...`  
  - Suppose `L = {00, 11}`  
  - Then `L* = {0000, 0011, 1100, 1111, 00, 11, emptystring, 001100, ...}`
  - `L*` is infinite unless `L = {emptystring} or L = {}`  
 - `L+ = {x1...xn:n > 0, xi elementof L for all i}`  
  - `{00, 01}+ = {00, 01, 0001, 0100, ...}`
  - Same as Kleene star but without the emptystring  
 - Union! `L1 U L2` is as you would expect
