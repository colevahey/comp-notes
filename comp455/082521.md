### Homework 1 Due Tonight
### Homework 2 Due Next Week
Do the readings for next class if you want to get ahead  
### For gradescope, put names on paper for people in group

## Languages cont.
```
{a, b}* = ({a}*)({b}{a}*)*
WMS LHS is a subset of RHS and RHS is a subset of LHS

LHS is all strings of a & b (i.e. {a, b, ab, ba, aba, ...})

        a*    ba*         *
RHS is (a..a)(b(a..a)b(a..)...)

It is easy to see that any string on the LHS is just
a combination of what occurs in the RHS
```

**Q: Languages may be infinite; how to describe them?**  
 - Language generators (using an algorithm to generate the
   language)  
 - Language acceptors (Just be able to validate strings in
   language)  
 - Mathematical descriptions
 - Explicit listing  

### Regular Expressions
Specify a set of languages precisely  
E = {0}{1}\*U{1}{0}\* (the expression)  
L = ℒ (E) is the language  

A **Regular Language** is a language defined by a **REGULAR
EXPRESSION**  

`L is a regular language if there exists a regular
expression (E) such that L = ℒ (E)`  

**Equations between Languages:**  
```
{a, b}* != {a}*{b}*
BECAUSE on RHS all the bs follow the as
The LHS includes "abab" but that cannot be included in the RHS

{a}*{b}* != {a}* U {b}*
BECAUSE LHS includes strings of as AND bs but the RHS only
includes strings of as OR bs
The LHS includes "ab" but that cannot be included in the RHS

ℒ (emptyset*) = {emptystring}
BECAUSE duh
```

FYI: `ℒ (ab) = ℒ (a)ℒ (b)`  

Regular expressions **DO NOT** contain brackets or commas  
ONLY characters, stars, and unions  

```
Give a regular expression for every binary string of even
length:

((01)*(10)*(00)*(11)*)*
OR ((0U1)(0U1))*
```

```
What language is represented byt he regular expression
((a*a)b)Ub)?

{b, ab, aab, aaab, aaaab, ...} = a*b
```
