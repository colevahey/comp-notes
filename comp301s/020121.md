### More git
Branches
- `git branch dev`
  - New branch `dev` at the most recent commit

Checkout
- Use `git checkout [commit]`
  - Get back to a commit or branch

Add
- `git add .`
  - Stage all changes into commit

##### Branching and Merging
- Making changes on different branches means you get actual
  real branches in git
- Parallel versions of project code
- `git checkout dev; git merge main`
  - Git automatically merges these files if it is simple
  - There will be merge conflicts if the branches have
    problems converging

##### Fetching, Pulling, and Pushing
- `git fetch`
  - Download new commits from Github to the local repo
  - Puts it into the `.git` folder
- `git pull`
  - Same as fetch but also integrates changes into the
    working folder
  - Can also fail with merge conflicts
- `git push`
  - Upload commits made in local repository to Github
  - Can fail with merge conflicts

##### Forking
- Creating a copy of a repo at a certain commit

### Continuous Integration
- The practice of regularly pushing your changes as you
  work, like multiple times a day, so the rest of your team
  can integrate your changes into their local versions in
  *real time*

### Object-Oriented Programming
##### Big Idea:
**Organize code into "units" (objects) which do two
things:**
- Define some data (fields)
- Define how to access and manipulate that data (methods)

**There is only *ever* one class definition in memory**
**When the class constructor is called, an instance is
created in memory**

###### Fields:
A member that stores a value
- `private double x;`
- `private static final double pi=3.14;`

Instance fields: NOT STATIC
- Stored with every instance of the class
- Each instance has it's own definition in memory
Class fields: STATIC
- Stored with the class definition in memory

###### Constructors:
Code that creates an instance
- `public [className]() { this.x = x }`

###### Methods:
A member that stores code
- `public sayName() {}`

Instance Methods: NOT STATIC
- Operates on a specific instance of a class
- Has access to `this` (referring to the instance)
Class Methods: STATIC
- Use static keyword
- Do not have access to `this`, cannot work with the
  instance
- **Can call on the class rather than a specific instance**
