### Java Build Process
- In software engineering, the *build process* is the act of
  converting a project's source material into a shippable
  software product
- Build process tasks vary from project to project and from
  language to language

## Maven
- Terminology:
- `pom.xml`
  - Main project configuration file
- Dependency
  - External module or library that your project uses
- Archetype
  - A template for creating new Maven projects
  - We won't have to worry about these, but know they exist
- Artifact
  - The packaged output file(s) produced by the project
  - `.jar`
- Lifecycle
  - A configurable build process task

## IntelliJ Semester Project Configuration
- Source code files in `src/main/`
- Testing files in `src/test/`
- Output files in `target/`
- Config file `pom.xml`
- External libraries contain dependencies

**Maven automatically downloads and prepares dependencies you
include in the `pom.xml` metadata**
- Simply look up Maven and then the dependency on google and
  there will likely be a Maven snippet that you can copy
  into your config file

## Git version control
- **Version control** is the practice of *tracking changes*
  made to a codebase
  - Periodically captures changes to code
  - Archives all snapshots taken in case you need to refer
    back to them
VOCAB:
- Commit -> A "snapshot" of the codebase at a point in time
  - Focuses on the *changes* made since the last commit
