# Red-Black Trees
  - INVARIANTS: Normal BST invariants
    - Value at node is larger than everything on the left and
    smaller than everything on the right
  - Each node is either red or black
    - Requires additional memory for nodes
  - The root is always black
  - Red nodes must have a black parent
    - Also, red nodes always have black children
    - Never hit two red nodes in a row
 
  - **Every path from the root to the bottom of the tree encounters the same number of black nodes**
  - Red-black trees are kinda balanced
  - Black height of a node is the number of black nodes from
   that node to the base of the tree (BH)
  - Height of a R-B tree is O(logN)
    - SPECIFICALLY _2log2(N+1)_
  - LEMMA: Any subtree rooted at X has *at least* 2^(BH(X)) - 1
  - LEMMA: For R-B tree with height h, BH(root) >= h/2
  - R-B Trees always have O(logN)
  - INSERTION
    - Insert new node as a red node just like normal BST
    insertion
    - Call the new node x
    - Four cases:
      - Parent of x is black
      - Parent of x is red and uncle is red
      - Parent of x is red and uncle is black/empty
      - x is the root of the R-B tree and has no parent node
    - Case 1: No issues, all good
    - Case 2: Problem - two reds in a row
      - Have to recolor, make parent and uncle black, then
     recolor grandparent red and check the problem at the
     grandparent
    - Case 3: LL, LR, RL, RR, do same rotations as in an AVL
    tree
      - Whichever node ends up at the top of the rotation
      becomes black, the children become red
      - Re-evaluate at the new top node
    - Case 4: Recolor node black
  - DELETION
    - Little more complicated
    - If value to be deleted is at a node with two children
      - Copy successor value to that node, recursively delete
     from right child
    - If value to be deleted is at a leaf or a node with only
    one child
      - If red, do normal BST deletion and you're done
      - If black, do normal BST deletion and THEN
        - If replaced by red only child, recolor as black
        - If replaced by black only child or empty tree, BH
      invariant may be violated so fix it
      - Recolors and rotate
      
  - **PERFORMANCE**
    - Performance of R-B is same as AVL
    - O(logN) for everything
    - Lookup, insertion, deletion
