# Delete from AVL
  - If value does not match root, recursively  down to find
   deletion
  - When match is found, if leaf, replace with empty tree
  - If match has one non-empty child, replace with child
  - If match has two non-empty children, replace value with
   smallest value (successor) from right child _then_ recursively
   delete the successor from the right child
  - After deletion, check height of children and fix balance
  - Deletion Imbalances:
    - Z is out of balance node
    - Y is child of Z with greater height
