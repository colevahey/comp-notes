# GRAPHING Pt. 2

 - Adjacency Matrix
   - Table of VxV with the graph vertexes
   - Table goes from source to destination marked either true
    or false if there is an edge betewen them
   - For WEIGHTED EDGES, use same table but instead of true
    and false, use numbers to indicate edge weight
   - NOT USED OFTEN, vertices must be identified by index to
    be put in arrays
     - This makes it difficult for dynamic graphs, i.e.
      mutable graphs
     - WASTED SPACE
       - Space required is O(|V|^2)
       - Undirected graphs store each edge twice
       - Ok if |E| = |V|^2 butt not if |E| << |V|^2
     - ADJACENCY TEST is time expensive O(V)
   - Sparse vs Dense
     - Dense = |E| = |V|^2
     - Sparse = |E| << |V|^2
     - Sparse can be surprisingly dense
  - Adjacency List
    - Vertex model where vertexes include a list of edges
    associated with those vertexes
    - For example, each vertex contains a list of adjacent
    vertexes
    - Another, model both vertexes and edges as objects,
    definition of vertex includes reference to edge
  - SPACE NEEDED: O(|V| + |E|)
  - Directed edges have a source and destination
  - Undirected edges have just different endpoints, but must
    point to the vertexes they sit between
    - Slightly complicates adjacency tests
  - Vertex and Edge Maps:
    - Very often will need a map for vertexes
    - Hashmap provides O(1) lookup for vertexes rather than
     O(V) for list etc looking through all vertexes
    - Topographical sorting, cannot have cycles in DAG
    - (A->B), (A->C), (C->B) sorted is A,C,B
    - A has no in-edges and B has no out-edges! Can be
     sorted because there is no cycle
    - To sort, find vertex with in-degree 0, then whatever
     vertexes that one is mapped to, make their in-degree
     one less, and repeat the process until the last vertex
      - O(|V|+|E|) operation
      - Actual time complexity also depends on graph
       implementation choices
      - In order to make this happen, compute initial
       in-degree of each vertex when the graph is built
       O(|V|)
      - Scan through all vertices at the beginning, identify
       all in-degree 0 vertexes, and add them to a queue
       O(|V|)
      - Then while queue not empty, add the 0-in vertex to
       the sort, decrement its adjacent vertexes in-degree
       by 1
