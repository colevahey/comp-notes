# Hash Map

O(1) Average case for insert, delete, and find
put("Cole", 40)
index = hash("Cole") % sizeMap
map[index] = "Cole", 40

Hashing - O(K) where K = size(key)
Hashing should decorrelate keys, like the hashes of similar
keys should create very different hashes

Handling Collisions
 1. Chaining
  - Every entry in the hash table is a list of keys
    - New key values are put in the list at the hash of the
    key mod size index
    - GET - O(1)
    - PUT - O(1) average case
    - PUT - O(N) worst case, may need to resize table when
    load limit reached (> 1.0)
 2. Probing
  - Use a "next" function for when there is a collision
  - Repeat until there's an open slot
  - Linear probing, just try the next slot until you find an
    open one (hashvalue + 1 % tableSize)
  - Works as long as the load < 1.0
  - Best practice is to resize if the load reaches 0.5
  - GET - O(1)
  - PUT - O(1) average case
  - PUT - O(N) worst case, may need to resize the table

 - Remove is easy for chain based implementation, simply
   delete key-value pair from index
 - Remove is harder for probe because you cannot remove
   a slot that might be passed over in probing
 - When you remove a key, you occupy the slot with an
   inactive value!!
 - When an inactive slot is encountered while probing for
   a put, you can replace inactive with new key-value
 - Called lazy deletion
