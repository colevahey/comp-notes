# GRAPH
 - G = (V,E) where V is the set of vertices (nodes) and E is the set
   of edges (arcs)
 - E = {(a,b) | a in V and b in V}
   - _DIRECTED GRAPH ^^_
   - a and b are an ordered pair, aka there is a direction to
    the edge
   - We say b is **adjacent** to a if (a,b) in E
 - E = {{a,b} | a in V and b in V}
   - _UNDIRECTED GRAPH ^^_
   - G = {{a,b,c}, {{a,b}, {a,c}}}

 - Some directed graphs have **weight** in the form of an
   integer
 - So E = {(s, d, w) | s in V and d in V and w in INT}

**Path**
   - Sequence of vertices V1, V2, V3, ..., Vn where (Vi,
    Vi+1) in E for 0 < i < n
   - Length of path = n - 1

 - Two types of path are simple and not simple
 - Simple paths do not visit any nodes twice, unless the
   repeated node is the first and last node (see cycle)
 - Cycles are paths with at least one edge with the first
   node and last node the same (simple cycle)
 - Cycles in undirected graphs are slightly different, edges
   must be distinct so E = {{a,b}} is not just a cycle in
   itself between a and b

**DAC - Directed Acyclic Graph**
   - No cycles exist in the Directed Graph
   - Trees are DAGs

**Connected**
   - An undirected graph is one that has a path from every
    vertex to every other vertex
   - An undirected graph is WEAKLY connected if there are
    paths from every vertex to every other vertex in its
    undirected form

**Complete**
   - An undirected graph is considered complete if every node 
    has an edge to every other node
   - N nodes means N(N-1)/2 edges

**Planar**
   - All edges can be drawn on a plane with none crossing
   - K4 is the largest complete graph that is planar
   - Rule of thumb, if plane is drawn on paper with no
    crossing edges, it is planar
   - If it has crossing edges, try to rubber band edges to
    get a planar graph
 
**Bipartite**
   - Nodes connected by edges are in two distinct sets
   - G = {{a, b, c}, {(a,b), (a,c)}} is bipartite because the
    two distinct sets could be {a} and {b,c}
   - Can think of bipartite as coloring with two different
    colors
   - Basically forms a relation with a domain and a codomain
