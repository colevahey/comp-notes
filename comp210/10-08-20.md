# Self Balancing Search Trees
 - Trees have invariants which mean we know what happens
   when items are inserted or deleted
 - Balance of your tree determines performance
 - For simple BSTs we have used, shape of tree depends on
   our order of insertion and deletion
 - So runtime is affected based only on our order
 - We always want to operate at O(logN) with a totally
   balanced tree
 - So self-balancing implementation
   - Maintains BST invariants
   - Ensures BST is balanced!

**AVL Tree**
 - Adelson-Velsky and Landis (AVL)
 - At any node, the height of the left child is no more than
   one different than the height of the right child
 - AVL BST Invariants
 - Same as BST, only difference is that it is balanced
 - Need a Rotation operation to rebalance
   - Adjustment operation to modify the tree when it needs to
    rebalance
   - A tree can be rotated to promote root value of a child
    to be the new overall root value while maintaining the
    BST invariants
   - Two symmetric flavors
    1. Right Rotation
       - Original root rotates to become the root of the
        right child
    2. Left rotation
       - Original root rotates to become the root of the left
        child
        
**Right Rotation**
  - Before rotation:
    - Left child is not empty
    - Right child may be empty
    - BST invariants hold
  - After rotation:
    - Root of original left child is now root of the tree
    - Original root is now root of right child
    - Right child of left child of root becomes left child of
    the new right child when root rotates
    - BST invariants hold
  - Left rotation is the same thing, just the opposite
   direction
 
**Inserting into AVL**
  - Start with valid AVL
  - BST Invariants hold
  - Balance condition holds (AVL)
  - INSERTION ALGORITHM
    - Recursively insert into either left or right child
    depending on value inserted like BST insertion
    - Insertion results in a new leaf somewhere at bottom of
    tree
    - Now there may be an imbalance
      - The imbalance must occur somewhere on the route between
     the new value and the root
  - Balance factor => B(x) = H(L(x)) - H(R(x))
    - Can legally be -1, 0, 1
  - After insertion, go from leaf back up through parents to
   check balance factor
    - Stop at node where balance is messed up
    - Need to keep track of previous two nodes in recursion
    - x, y, z are the three nodes
    - z is where imbalance occurs
    - y is child of z
    - x is child of y
    - Looks like one of four cases:
      - LL
      - RR
      - LR
      - RL
    - LL or RR Rotate node where imbalance occurs
      - Rotate right if imbalance comes from left child
      - Rotate left if imbalance comes from right child
    - LR or RL Rotate at y before rotating at z
