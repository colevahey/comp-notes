# Minimum Spanning Tree
  - Spanning tree of G is a tree formed using edges within
   G and all of the vertices of G
  - MST is a Spanning Tree with the smallest possible edge
   weight sum
  - In an UNWEIGHTED graph, all spanning trees are MSTs
    - This is because all the edges are the same weight so
    every collection of |V| - 1 edges will have the same
    total weight
  - If every edge has a different weight, there is only one
   MST

**Kruskal's Algorithm for MST**
  - Greedy algorithm!
    - Make the best choice at every given time
    - Gives us the best final solution at the end
  - Build forest, merge trees into one
  - Select edges in order of smallest weight up
  - Stop when all vertices have been connected
  - Reject an edge when it creates a cycle!
  - RUNTIME
    - Generate a sorted list of edges O(|E|log|E|) plus O(1)
    to retrieve edges
    - OR O(|E|) to build binary heap of edges plus O(log|E|)
    to retrieve edges
    - So either way, O(|E|log|E|)
      - second one slightly better assuming all of the edges
       will not have to be checked to make the MST

**Prim's Algorithm for MST**
  - Also greedy algorithm
  - Pick a node and add it to tree T
  - Examine edges and add the one with the lowest weight and
   destination that is not already in the tree
  - Vertex destination from the edge gets added to the tree
  - Now find lowest weight from ALL vertices in the tree
  - Reject edges that form cycles
  - Go until |V| - 1 edges found
