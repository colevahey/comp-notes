# Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Shortest path algorithm from vertex v to vertex w in
   a graph (can be weighted or unweighted)
  - Input: G=(V,E) and a start vertex s
  - Output: Shortest paths from s to every other vertex
  - Unweighted algorithm is fairly simple
  - *BAD* way to do it has runtime complexity of O(|V|^2)
  - C (current) is marked 0 to start
  - current distance is 0
  - Find all nodes marked 0
  - Those have a distance of 0 to c
  - Add 1 to all nodes adjacent to c
  - Then find all nodes marked 1
  - Those have a distance of 1 to c
  - Add 1 to all nodes adjacent to those marked 1
  - Continue this process until all path lengths are covered
   O(|V|^2) worst case
  - Unweighted shortest path, create a queue and add as we
   find adjacent vertices
    - THIS IS O(|V| + |E|)
    - Enqueue adjacent vertices, dequeue next vertex
  - DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
    - Weighted shortest path
    - We use a priority queue for adjacent nodes
    - No longer able to do a breadth-first search
    - Must dequeue by lowest weighted value!! i.e. Priority
    Queue
    - Use a priority queue to hold adjacent nodes
    - Add vertexes to queue with their weighted lengths as
    their priority
