## Model View Controller
**MVC:** A *software design pattern* used for structuring
and organizing your code for applications with a user
interface  
**Big Idea:** Separate the app's UI code from the state
management code  

**Model:** Stores the application state  
Provides algorithms for data manipulation  
**Controller:** Handles user interactions by calling
appropriate model methods  
**View:** Creates and displays the user interface  
Observes for user interactions  

### Example Model
```Java
public class Model {
  private List<Player> players;
  private List<Observer> observers;
  private int turn;

  public Player getActivePlayer() {
    return players.get(turn);
  }

  public void notifyObservers() {
    for (Observer o : observers) {
      o.update(this);
    }
  }

  public void endTurn() {
    turn = turn % (players.size() - 1) + 1;
    notifyObservers();
  }
}
```

### View Responsibilities
The view *generates the UI*  
The view *refreshes the UI when the app state changed*  
The view *observes for user interactions*
