## Announcements
### A02 due 2/28 (done :))
Autograder will be released Tuesday or Wednesday  
### Q01 on Wednesday
Quiz details at the end of today's class  
Review session tonight at 7pm  
Last semester's quiz on Sakai in resources!!!
**Use this to study^^**  

## Composition and Aggregation
Making smaller objects work together  

### Layers of Abstraction
#### Simple classes  
Fields are primitive data types  
A class is simply a container for its data  
Classes define operations on their fields  

#### Complex classes  
Details encapsulated in a class are **complex** enough to
warrant additional layers of abstraction  
Encapsulated fields are objects themselves  
The ***fields*** of these classes are objects themselves  

## Aggregation and Composition
**Aggregation** and **composition** are relationships where
one object encapsulates instances of other objects  

### Aggregation
The internal objects might exist independently on their own  
EX: Backpack full of item objects

### Composition
The objects only exist together as a unit  
EX: Car parts  

## Composition and Inheritance
Composition works best if the functionality is separable  
In memory, composition is simpler as well  

**No hierarchy** - Everything defined in one class (on heap)  
**Inheritance** - Lots of classes encapsulating one another on
the heap  
**Composition** - One instance on heap has fields which point to
Objects in other places on the heap  

Try to break down your problems to be able to use
composition  
WHENEVER designing a system, look for ways to break down
a problem into smaller components  
Use **inheritance** when the problem seems hierarchical  
Use **composition/aggregation** when components are independent  
When given the choice, favor composition!  

## Abstract classes
```Java
Person j = new Professor("John");

// Will throw error if getStatus() isn't defined in Person
// Because Person doesn't have that method
j.getStatus();
```

SOLUTION:  
Implement a dummy method in `Person` that is overridden  
OR  
Declare `Person` an abstract class  
Declare `getStatus()` as an abstract method with
implementation
