## Encapsulation Review
Bundling data together with the methods that operate on that
data  
Shield the object's internals from the rest of the
application  

### Access Modifiers
`private` - The member is only accessible from inside the
class body  
`protected` - The member is only accessible from inside the
class and subclasses  
`default` - The member is accessible from anywhere inside
the package  
`public` - The member is accessible from anywhere

### Class Design
**Rule of thumb** - When designing a class, choose to
*expose* methods that represent fundamental actions related
to the semantic meaning of the object  
- Don't expose the `changeCapacity()` method of the class
  `backpack` because you can't do that in real life
- Don't expose the `setTopLeft()` method of the class `square` because you can't do that in real life either  
**Rule of thumb** - When designing a class, choose to
*encapsulate* fields that fundamentally identify the object,
and try to avoid redundant fields  
- Don't store `int width` & `int height` of the class
  `square`; you already have both of those values given one  

**Derived field** - An imaginary "field" that is actually
just a combination or transformation of other fields
- These "fields" do not need to be stored, but can be
  derived on the spot  
`double getArea() { return side * side; }`
The area is returned acting like a "field", but really the
field is just side

Setter trick: **Validation** - When writing a setter method,
add code to validate the incoming value *before updating the
field*  
If an improper value is detected, throw an error to end the
program  

**Immutability** - A value that cannot be changed  
- If all fields of an Object are immutable, we say that the
  Object is immutable

### Encapsulation Recipe
1. Make all instance fields `private` (or `protected`)
2. Initialize instance fields in the `public` constructor
3. Add **getter and setter methods** as necessary to expose
   the raw field values
4. Carefully choose `public` methods to expose
5. Consider making an *interface* to clearly indicate which
   methods are exposed  

## Inheritance
Person and Superman  
`public class Superman extends Person {}`  
`Superman` receives all the members of `Person`  
Use `super()` as the first line of the `Superman` constructor
to call the superclass constructor
