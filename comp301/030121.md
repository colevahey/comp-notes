## Errors and Testing
**What is an error/exception?**  
An unexpected, unusual, or abnormal situation  
Arises before or during execution of a program  
At the very least, it is disruptive to the user  

### Early Error Handling Strategies  
**Strategy #1**  
**Global error code**  
Add a well-documented *global variable*  
Change the variable value when something goes wrong  
Define and use a *system of error codes* to indicate what
error occurred  
The programmer is responsible for checking the value when
appropriate (NOT VERY EFFICIENT)  

**Strategy #2**  
**Special return value**  
Designate special return values meant to be interpreted as
errors  

**Procedure conventions:**  
0 indicates success  
Less than 0 indicates an error  
Different negative values indicate different errors (as
documented)  

**Function conventions:**
If a reference type is returned, then use null to signal an
error  
If a value type is returned, then use an "out of bounds"
value to indicate an error  

**DRAWBACKS of these strategies:**  
Inconsistent, convention-based  
Methods must have out-of-range return values to use for
indicating that an error occurred  
Relies on documentation to explain what each error value
means  
The programmer must remember to check for errors  
Hard to extend to larger projects
