## Latches
### Digital Storage Element (D Latch)
Stores **1 bit** of data  

INPUT: D, G, Q-old  
OUTPUT: Q  

IF G then Q = D  
ELSE Q = Q-old  

### D Flip-Flop Design and Operation
Input signal controls when Q is changed to input D  

The clock events control when Q is changed!
Q is only changed to D when there is a "rising-edge clock
event"  

INPUT: D, CLK  
OUTPUT: Q  

IF CLK Switch On then Q = D-current  
Else Pass

### Register (Memory)
RS - Reset bit  
R/W - Read/Write bit  
CLK - Clock  
d0, d1, d2, d3, d4 - Inputs  
x0, x1, x2, x3, x4 - Outputs
