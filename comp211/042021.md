## OS Fundamentals
### Process Model
**First - Some Terminology:**  
*Process Creation* - Explicit request of an existing
process; The OS creates a new process  
*Parent Process* - Existing process; Running in memory; The
"creator"  
*Child process* - New process; The "createe"  

### Process Creation
The **explicit request** of an existing process  
*specifically a parent process*  

Parent process executes a **system call**  
Specifically, `fork()` system call  
This creates a new process (child)  

**Fork Big Picture**  
4 Steps:  
1. Assign a unique process ID to the child process and
   update parent PCB (process control block)  
2. Make a copy of the parent process (exception of any
   shared memory)  
3. Assigns the child process to the Ready to Run state  
4. Returns the ID number of the child to the parent process,
   and a 0 value to the child process

The Child Process copies the contents of the Parent Process
THEY DO NOT SHARE THE PROCESS IN MEMORY  

### Example
SSH into system - PID: 1 (systemd)
*fork*  
Receive Bash Terminal - PID: 2704 (sshd)
*fork*  
Create executable object file - PID: 13759 (sshd)  
*fork*  
Run Execute program (./a.out) - PID: 13816 (sshd)
*fork*  
Parent process - PID: 13822 (bash)

### Exec System Call
Replaces the current process in memory with the new process  
Loads executable object file (a.out) in memory  
**clobbers stack, heap, text, data, rodata, etc. forked from
parent process**  
Write over the parent process data 

### Process Execution
Process execution -> Fork and Exec system calls completed  
Process in -> Ready to Run  

### Process Stack and Activation Records
Stack is a LIFO data structure  
Conceptually pushing and popping local variables defined in
an activation record (AR)  

When a function is called, an Activation Record is created  
When a function returns, the AR is destroyed  

Frame Pointer is a memory address to the start of the AR  
Stack Pointer is a memory address to the top of the AR  

Activation records aren't REALLY destroyed, they just remain
in memory until they are written over
