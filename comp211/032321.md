```

On all of these, be careful of **DeMorgan's Laws**  
AKA `~(A AND B) = ~A OR ~B`  

The `AND` is a half oval gate in the diagram  
The `OR` is more of a beak shape, a sharp half oval  
The `XOR` looks like `OR` but with an extra line in front of
the gate  
Also, the `o` in the logic gate `->o` means a negation  

### Multiple-Input Logic Gates
```
AND3

Schematic Diagram
A
B -> Y
C

Boolean Expression
Y = ABC

 A | B | C | Y
---------------
 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 
 0 | 0 | 1 | 0
 0 | 1 | 0 | 0
 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 
 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 
 1 | 0 | 1 | 0
 1 | 1 | 0 | 0
 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
```

### NOTATION
```
AND => xy
OR => x+y
NOT => x̄
NAND => xy (BARRED)
NOR => x+y (BARRED)
XOR => x⊕y
XNOR => x⊕y (BARRED)
```

### Basic Identities
```
X + 0 = X
X + 1 = 1
X + X = X
X + ~X = 1
~~X = X

X1 = X
X0 = 0
XX = X
X~X = 0

X + Y = Y + X
X + (Y + Z) = (X + Y) + Z
X(Y + Z) = XY + XZ
~(X + Y) = ~X~Y

XY = YX
X(YZ) = (XY)Z
X + YZ = (X + Y)(X + Z)
~(XY) = ~X + ~Y
```

### DeMorgan's Identity
We want to push the bubble from the output to the input  
**SO** we'd rather have `~X + ~Y` than `~(XY)`  
Push the bar to each input, rather than the whole output
