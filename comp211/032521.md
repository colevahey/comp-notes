## Circuit Design
### Design Approach: Sum-of-Products
Ex: `Y = ABC + ~A~BC + A~BC`  
**Three steps:**  
1. Define the truth table
2. Write down a boolean expression for every row with a 1 in
   the output
3. Wire up the gates!  

**SO:**  
```
 A | B | C | Y
---------------
 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
 0 | 0 | 1 | 1
 0 | 1 | 0 | 0
 0 | 1 | 1 | 0
 1 | 0 | 0 | 1
 1 | 0 | 1 | 1
 1 | 1 | 0 | 0
 1 | 1 | 1 | 1

    Row 2   Row 5  Row 6  Row 8
Y = ~A~BC + A~B~C + A~BC + ABC
```

### DeMorgan's
Start from the output and start pushing the bubble,
switching the gates as you go  

If you have two bubbles between operators, they cancel out  

Push the bubbles all the way back to the inputs! So no
operations should be notted, just the inputs  

`ANOTHER SUM OF PRODUCTS: F = ~A + ~B + AC + ~D`  

### Multiplexers
Multiple inputs but select one of them  

```
A - 0-
B - 1 |
C - 2 |_ Y
D - 3 |
      |
S ----

IF S = 00, Y = A
IF S = 01, Y = B
IF S = 10, Y = C
IF S = 11, Y = D
```
