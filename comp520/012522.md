### Elimination of Left Recursion
N ::= X | NY  
N ::= X (Y)\*  

### Informal Definitions of Grammar Properties
**Nonterminal set N, Start symbol S, Terminal set T**  
Assume one rule per nonterminal  
Multiple rules with same NT at left can be combined  

**NULLABLE(alpha):** Property that is True IFF alpha can
derive the empty string  
**STARTERS[alpha]:** Set of terminals that may start
derivations from alpha (includes the empty string if
Nullable(alpha))  
**FOLLOWERS[A] where A in N:** Set of terminals that may
follow A in a derivation (For augmented grammars, only
Followers[S] includes the empty string)  

### Informal LL(1) Condition for EBNF Grammars
**Idea:** For each choice of the form A ::=
Beta(a1|...|am)gamma, Starters[alpha-i] and
Starters[alpha-j] must be disjoint for all i,j <= m  
For each repetition of the form A ::= Beta(a)\*y  
Starters[a] and Starters[y] are disjoint  
Nullable(a) is False  

LL(1) -> Grammar can be parsed with only one symbol of
lookahead  

### Nullability(A)
If a Nonterminal can be evaluated to only a terminal, it is
not nullable. However, if a nonterminal gets evaluated to
a nonterminal, its nullability depends on that next nonterminal

### Starters[A]
Any terminals that can appear first in a derivation of
the nonterminal A  

### Followers[A]
Any terminals that appear directly following the parse of
nonterminal A
