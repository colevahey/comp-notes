## Contextual Analysis: Identification
**Identifiers:**  
Identifiers and what they denote  
Scopes  
**Identification:**  
Implementation Strategies  

**Identifiers are:** Defined (introduced)  
Typically through declarations  
Sometimes "pre-defined" (eg true/false in Triangle)  

**Identifiers are:** Referenced (used)  
Occurrences other  than in a declaration  
We generally call these references  
Our book calls them "applied occurrences"  

**Identification:** Record definitions of identifiers and
their attributes when they are declared  

**In the AST ->** Record definitions in Declaration nodes
and *link* references to defining declaration  

### Scope of a Declaration
**Monolithic Block Structure**  
All declarations are in a single global scope  
No identifier can be declared more than once  

**Flat Block Structure**  

**Nested Block Structure**  
Arbitrary nesting of blocks (modern programming)  
Declarations in a more deeply nested block hide those in
enclosing blocks  

### Identification Table (ie Symbol Table)
Maps identifier names to attributes  
Attributes vary greatly depending on the category of
identifier  
*Strategy:* The attributes of an identifier are in the AST
node where it is declared  
All declaration nodes in miniJava AST are subtype of
Declaration (Decl)  

*Implementation:*  
(Auto-Expanding) hashtable  
O(n) amortized access cost for O(n) insertions and lookups  
Java: `class HashMap<String, Decl>`  

### Logical Order of Contextual Analysis
**Identification**  
Check validity of declarations -> is this declaration
allowed in the current context?  
Link references in corresponding declarations  
AST traversal order -> top down, declarations before
references  

**Type Checking**  
Assign types to expressions  
Check type agreement -> operators and operands, assignment
statements  
AST traversal order -> bottom up (assuming no overloading)  

### Contextual Analysis in a Single Traversal
**For each node,**  
Inherit some information from parent  
Traverse subtree rooted at node  
Synthesize some information to return to parent  

**Traversing the subtree rooted at a node**  
For each child in turn, apply contextual analysis on child,
provide inherited data, receive synthesized data
