## Contextual Analysis
**Identification:**  
IdTables =>  
enter(String s, Decl d) = associate s with Decl d  
Decl retrieve(String s) = yields decl or null  

Specific id tables =>  
Is *s* a class name?  
Is *s* a member of class X?  

*Scoped* id table =>  
enter or exit a scope  
what declaration is associated with *s* in the current
scope?   
Is *s* already declared in the current scope?  
Is *s* already declared in a bigger scope? (cannot reuse
variable names that are deeply nested)  
Otherwise, add *s* to the IdTable
