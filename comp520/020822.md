## Abstract Syntax Trees
The big difference between an Abstract syntax tree and
a Concrete syntax tree is that ASTs are
almost always ambiguous and broader than CSTs  

A Concrete syntax is described by an EBNF CFG  

Abstract syntax can be described by a simple CFG  

Rules for AST Classes:  
 - Create abstract class AST  
 - For each nonterminal in AST grammar, construct an
   abstract subclass of AST  
 - For each choice within a rule, construct a concrete
   subclass of the LHS nonterminal
