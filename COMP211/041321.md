## Announcements
### Nice work on Exam 2
### No quiz this week!!
### Lab07 released today

## NEW TOPIC: Operating Systems
### System: Software and Hardware
**SOFTWARE:**  
  Application Programs  
  Libraries  
  Operating System  
**HARDWARE:**  
  CPU (Registers, ALU, Datapath, MMU, Cache)  
  Bus  
  I/O Devices and Networking  
  Main Memory  

### Processes
**Process:** A program during execution  
A process is the *basic unit of execution* in an operating
system  

At a minimum, process execution requires the following
resources:  
**Memory** to contain the program code and data  
**CPU Registers** to support the execution  

### Process Life Cycle
**Processes are always either:**  
*Executing*, *Waiting to execute*, or *Blocked waiting for
an event to occur*  

Start -> Ready -> Blocked -> Running -> Done OR BACK TO
Ready  

### Process Control Block (PCB)
**Components:**  
- Identifier
- State  
- Priority  
- Program Counter  
- Memory Pointers  
- Context Data  
- IO Status ID  
- Accounting Information  

### CPU Scheduling
*Main Problem:* Choosing which process to run next
