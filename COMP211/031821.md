### Quiz 4 on Friday
Study materials on Sakai  
Pollev practice today  
### Lab 05 posted
GET STARTED  
Not super difficult but you need to understand the problem  

## More addressing
**The page table is held in TLB on the CPU**  
The TLB is managed by the MMU, but a copy of the page tables
are also stored in memory and on disk  
Page table operations are handled by the MMU  

WORST CASE SCENARIO:  
Address lookup in virtual memory is a miss, so go over the
bus to map virtual to the physical address  
THEN with the physical address, look in cache but if it's
not there, then go back over the bus to grab the data and
put it in cache  
THEN put the data in the register  

## Pollev Practice
Q: On a 64-bit system, what is the size (in bytes) of one word?  
A: **8** (64 bits / 8 bits per byte)

Q: On a 16-bit byte addressable system where main memory
address locations are aligned in word increments, if one
block has 16 words what size of the block in bytes?  
A: **32** (16 words * 2 bytes per word)  

Q: On a 16-byte addressable system where main memory address
locations are aligned in word increments, if the size of one
block is 32 bytes, what is the number of word-offset bits
(w)?  
A: **5** (32 byte block size = 2^w offset bits so w = 5)  

Q: On a 32-bit byte addressable system where main memory
address locations are aligned in word increments, if the
system includes a 128 line cache that uses direct mapping
what are the number of line bits?  
A: **7** (128 line cache = 2^l, need 7 bits to represent 128
lines in binary)
