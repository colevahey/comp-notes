## Announcements
### Quiz 3 very good
### Lab 03
Start early (done already :))  
### First Exam
Friday, March 5th  
Similar to quizzes  
### New Lecture Topic Today - Memory Organization

## Memory Organization
### Memory Hierarchy
**CPU LEVELS** - Smaller, faster, costlier:  
L0: Registers  
L1: L1 cache (Static RAM)   
L2: L2 cache (SRAM)  
L3: L3 cache (SRAM)  

**NON CPU** - larger, slower, and cheaper (per byte):  
L4: Main memory (Dynamic RAM)  
L5: Local secondary storage (local disks)  
L6: Remote secondary storage (web servers)  

Registers, Cache, and Main Memory are *"volatile"* memories,
meaning they lose information if powered off  

**Nonvolatile Memories** - Retain value even if powered off  
**Read-only Memory (ROM)** - Programmed during production  
**Programmable ROM (PROM)** - Can be programmed once  
**Erasable PROM (EPROM)** - Can be bulk erased  
**Electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM)** - Electronic erase
capability  
**Flash memory** - EEPROM with partial (block-level) erase
capability  
*wears out after about 100000 erasings*  

#### CPU-Memory Gap
The CPU is faster, and is getting even faster at a quicker
pace than memory  

### RAM
Key features: RAM is traditionally packaged as a chip  
Basic storage unit is normally a cell (one bit per cell)  
Multiple RAM chips form memory  

**RAM comes in two varieties**  
SRAM (Static RAM): D Flip-Flop  
Hardware Part II: Circuit design  
DRAM (Dynamic RAM): Transistor and capacitor technology  
Learn more about in COMP 311  

*What exactly is Random Access?*  
ArrayList is an example of Random Access  
A LinkedList is an example of NOT Random Access  
**Memory is Random Access!!**  

SRAM vs DRAM  
SRAM 1x access time, no refresh, maybe error detection, 100x
cost, cache memories (registers)  
DRAM 10x access time, yes refresh, needs error detection, 1x
cost, main memories  

**Traditional Bus Structure:**  
A bus is a collection of parallel wires that carry address,
data, and control signals  
Buses are typically shared by multiple devices  

Memory Read Transaction:  
CPU places address A on the memory bus  
Main memory reads A from the memory bus, retrieves word x,
and places it on the bus  
CPU read word x from the bus and copies it into register $t1  
**Takes longer because there are buses between CPU and
data**  

### Secondary Storage
Rotating magnetic disks - Old school  
Replaced with SSD  
Older systems still use  
Cheap but slow
