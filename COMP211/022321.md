### Quiz 3 Tomorrow (Open all day)
Focus on pointers  
### Exam 1 on Friday, March 5
Focus on representing info and then foundations of software  

**When the printf() function is executed on line two after
being called by main, how many activation records are there 
in memory?**  
```C
void foo() {
  printf("foo\n");
}

void bar() {
  foo();
}

int main() {
  bar();
  return 0;
}
```
**A**: 3!!  

### Execution Model (Linking)
C => asm (.s) => Object (.o) => executable (.out)  
Compiler    Assembler     Linker  
The linker grabs the static libraries (.a) and dynamic
libraries (.so) <= shared object  

#### Why Linkers?  
Modularity! - Program can be written as a collection of
smaller source files, rather than one monolithic mass  
Can build libraries of common functions (Math, stdio)  
Efficiency! - Separating compilation means faster, change
one source file, compile it, and then re-link  
Libraries have more space since common functions can be
aggregated  

#### How do linkers work?  
**Step 1: Symbol resolution**  
Programs define and reference *symbols* (global variables
and functions)  
Symbol definitions are stored in object file (by assembler)
in *symbol table*  
Symbol table is like an array of structs  
Each entry includes name, size, location or symbol  

**Step 2: Relocation**  
Merges separate code and data sections into single sections  
Relocates symbols from their relative locations in the .c
file  
Basically finds where all of the called functions are in
memory and adds them all to the single executable  

### Object Files
**Relocatable Object file (.o)**  
Contains code and data in a form that can be combined with
other relocatable object files to form executable object
file  
**Executable Object file (a.out)**  
Contains code and data in a form that can be executed  
**Shared Object file (.so)**  
Dynamic library!!
