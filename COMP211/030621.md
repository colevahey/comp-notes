## Announcements
### Second Exam on Friday
See Sakai Announcement  
### Lab06 due Sunday
Already done :)

## Memory Organization Continued
### SRAM
Matrix of D Flip Flops  
Each D Flip Flop is one bit  
Each row is one address, usually of 8 DFFs  

### Address Decoder
k INPUTS (address)  
N = 2^k DATA OUTPUTS  

It's just **a bunch of AND gates** that take the address
bits and turn on the selected output  

## Basic CPU Design
### Five-Stage CPU Design
1. Instruction Fetch (IF)  
2. Instruction Decode (ID)
3. Execute (EX)
4. Memory Access (MEM)
5. Writeback (WB)  

This is the *datapath* of the CPU  

### Instruction Fetch
Program Count (PC) Register -> Holds the memory address
location of the machine instruction to be fetched  

PC select (PCSEL) -> MUX that grabs the instruction set  

Instruction Memory -> Virtual address  

### Instruction Decode
Configures Data Path -> Decode instruction fields, R, I, or
J type instruction  

Control Logic -> INPUT OP and FUNC fields; OUTPUT Control
signals (PCSEL, WASEL ,etc.)  

Register File -> 32 general purpose registers, RS, RT, and
RD are 5-bits  

### Execute
Configure ALU -> Use ALU function bits to control logical
signal  

Perform ALU operation -> per config  

Two Inputs (n bits each) to One Output (n bits)

### Memory Address
Read (RD) or Write (WD) data to memory  
Cache or virtual address

### Writeback (Thursday)
