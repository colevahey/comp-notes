## Arrays
**Array** - Fixed-size collection of elements of the same
type  
```C
int A[10]; // Declaration
```
Length of array `A` = 10  
Start element is at index position `0`  
Can declare AND initialize with:
```C
int A[10] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
```
C *does not* throw an error if you ask for an array index
outside of its range  
It just gives you the value left in memory at that location  

## Structures
**Structure** - Collection of values placed under one name
in a single block of memory  
- Can put structs, arrays in other structs  
*Given a struct instance, access the fields using the
. operator*  
```C
struct foo_s {
  int a;  // Field
  char b; // Field
}

foo_s foosey; // Declare instance of struct
foosey.a = 2; // Set field of instance
```

## Casting
```C
int a = -5;
unsigned int b = (unsigned int) a; // b = 0
float c = (float) a; // c = -5.0
```

## Functions
Declaration:  
```C
// PROTOTYPE:
int add(int a, int b);
// or without param names
int add(int, int);
```
Implementation:
```C
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
