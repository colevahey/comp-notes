## Memory Organization
**Cache**  
A fast storage buffer in the central processing unit of
a computer also called cache memory  

Cache memories are small, fast SRAM-based memories managed
automatically in hardware  
CPU looks first for data in cache  
Holds frequently accessed blocks of main memory  

**General Cache Concept**  
Cache - Smaller, faster, more expensive memory caches
a subset of the blocks  
Data is copied in block-sized transfer units  
Memory - Larger, slower, cheaper memory viewed as
partitioned into "blocks"  

**Blocks in memory are identified by tag bits**  
The number of tag bits tells how many blocks there are in
memory  
Offset bits tell us which address of the block to get  

**When you ask for a memory access location, it gets the
block the address belongs to so that similar locations are
quickly accessible**  

The number of blocks in main memory is 2^a / 2^w  
a = addressable bits  
w = number of offset bits  

Addresses:  
```
0000
0001
0010
0011
0100
0101
0110
0111
```
So if we have a 4-address block size, you need 2 offset bits
to account for the four possible spots in the block in
binary  
Then when you cache a block, you need the tag bits (in this
example the first two) and then for the specific address you
have the offset bits  

SO block one includes `0000, 0001, 0010, 0011`  
`00` is the tag bits  
`00, 01, 10, 11` is the offset bits
