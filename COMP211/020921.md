## Coding Process
High Level  
Instruction Set  
Machine Language  

Instruction Set (Assembly)  
`addi $t0, $0, 10`

(opcode)  (rs)  (rt)   (immediate)  
 001000  00000 01001 0000000000001010  

addi opcode is 001000 in the MIPS specs  
Then looking for parameters in rs, rt, and immediate  

### CPU
**Registers** - Hold data and instructions; 32 of them
**ALU** - Arithmetic and Logic Unit  
**PC** - Program Counter (address of next instruction in
memory); a special register   

### Memory
- Organized by address locations; holds data and
  instructions!!  
**Code**  
**Data**  
**Stack**  

## C Basics
#### Main function
```C
int main() {
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  return 0;
}
```
C printf has format specifiers like `%c` and `%d`  
`#include ...` is an import statement  
`scanf("%d", &d);` reads characters from stdin 

#### Variable Declaration
`int a; // without initialization`  
`int a = 10; // with initialization`  
Block scope has local variables!!
