## Arithmetic Circuits
If you have an 8-bit adder, you need 8 adders  
Each takes a carry bit and two input bits, and then outputs
a sum bit and a carry bit to the next adder  

Use XOR for units to do both addition and subtraction  

So if `s = 0` then `B XOR s = B`  
**DO ADDITION**  

And if `s = 1` then `B XOR s = ~B`  
**DO SUBTRACTION**  

## ALU Circuit
### 5-bit ALU Function Selector
 Sub | Bool | Shft | Math | OP |
---------------------------------
 0 | XX | X | 1 | A + B |
 1 | XX | X | 1 | A - B |
 X | 00 | 1 | 0 | B << A | 
 X | 01 | 1 | 0 | B >> A |
 X | 10 | 1 | 0 | B >>> A |
 X | 00 | 0 | 0 | A & B |
 X | 01 | 0 | 0 | A | B |
 X | 10 | 0 | 0 | A ^ B |
 X | 11 | 0 | 0 | A XOR B |
