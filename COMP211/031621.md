## Memory Organization: Virtual Memory
CPU -> MMU -> Physical Memory  
Virtual addressing is done on the CPU  
Specifically in the **Memory Management Unit**  

The number of virtual address bits can be **MUCH LARGER**
than the number of physical address bits  
This gets rid of the physical address limitations!!  
Gives us more flexibility  

**5-bit virtual address example**  
Virtual Memory Address -> `4 3 2 1 0`  
Virtual Page Number `4 3 2`  
Virtual Page Offset `1 0`  
| Virtual Page # | Physical Page Frame # | Present Bit |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| 000            | 00                    | 1           |
| 001            | 11                    | 1           |
| 010            |                       | 1           | 
| 011            |                       | 0           |
| 100            |                       | 0           |
| 101            |                       | 0           |
| 110            |                       | 0           |
| 111            |                       | 0           |  
All of this is managed by the MMU
