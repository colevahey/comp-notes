## Memory Organization: Virtual Memory
CPU -> MMU -> Physical Memory  
Virtual addressing is done on the CPU  
Specifically in the **Memory Management Unit**  

The number of virtual address bits can be **MUCH LARGER**
than the number of physical address bits  
This gets rid of the physical address limitations!!  
Gives us more flexibility  

**5-bit virtual address example**  
Virtual Memory Address -> `4 3 2 1 0`  
Virtual Page Number `4 3 2`  
Virtual Page Offset `1 0`  
| Virtual Page # | Physical Page Frame # | Present Bit |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| 000            | 00                    | 1           |
| 001            | 11                    | 1           |
| 010            |                       | 0           | 
| 011            |                       | 0           |
| 100            |                       | 0           |
| 101            |                       | 0           |
| 110            |                       | 0           |
| 111            |                       | 0           |  

All of this is managed by the MMU
The VIRTUAL PAGE # gets you the PHYSICAL PAGE FRAME #  
Then the VIRTUAL PAGE OFFSET is your PHYSICAL OFFSET  

The page table is in the MMU on the CPU  
To add a physical memory block to the Page Table, find
a spot to map it and add the tag bits to the Page Table,
then mark it as present in the table  

Virtual page numbers are linear, you can do one after the
other  
**BUT** they can point to very different physical addresses
giving us more freedom to point where we need  

Virtual pages can contain more than one memory block! If
they add one extra offset bit, then each virtual page is TWO
memory blocks  

### Improved System Utilization
Program can be *larger than all of main memory*  
Improved address space because virtual (logical) addresses
have more space than physical addresses
