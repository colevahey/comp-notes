**Homework**
- First quiz next Friday 2/5

In a perfect world, we want *low* complexity and *high*
efficiency

### Base-2 Encoding (Binary)
- Each number is a sequence of bits (0s and 1s)
- Each bit is assigned a positional weight
- Weights are increasing powers of 2, right to left
- The value of an n-bit number is the sum of the bit weights

**Least Significant Bit (LSB)**
*Lowest power of two (RIGHT)*
**Most Significant Bit (MSB)**
*Highest power of two (LEFT)*

26(10) = 00011010(2)
81(10) = 01010001(2)

### Base-16 Encoding (Hexadecimal)
- Called hexadecimal or hex -> groups of 4 bits
  - 4 bit groups means that each group gives one hex char
  - Because 4 bits has *16* possible values
- **MAKES IT EASIER FOR US TO READ BINARY**
- Digits used are 0-9 and A-F
- Each hexit position represents a power of 16
- A=10...F=15

0111 1101 0000 (2)  = 2000(10)
 7    D    0   (16) = 2000(10)
`7 * 16^2 + D * 16^1 + 0 * 16^0 = 2000` 

**It is easier to go from b2 to b16 to b10 than to go
directly from b2 to b10**

### Base-8 Encoding (Octal)
- Similar to hex
- Groups of 3 bits (like hex)
- Again octal makes it easier for us to read, not very
  common

# Signed-Number Representations
### Signed Magnitude Representation
- The most significant bit is used for the sign
- First bit to b10 is -1^(bit)
- However, then 0000(2) and 1000(2) are both 0
  - This is dumb
- Adding and subtracting is complicated and complex
- We don't want either of these things, so signed magnitude
  is not used

### 2's Complement Representation
- Most significant bit is your sign bit
- **How to negate a number:**
  - Complement every bit (0->1, 1->0)
  - Add 1 to LSB

`5(10) = 0101(2) -> 1010 -> 1010 + 1 = 1011(2) = -5(10)`

```-5(10) + 2(10) = -3(10)
-5(10) = 1011(2)
2(10) = 0010(2)
 1011(2)
+0010(2)
________
=1101(2) = -(0010(2) + 1) = -(0011(2)) = -3(10)```
