**Lab 00 is up, simple env setup**
- Due Feb 1

*System* - A set of things working together as parts of
a mechanism or an interconnecting network.
- Computing: A group of related hardware units or programs
  or both, especially when dedicated to a single
  application.

COMP 211: Software of compiling, assembling, and linking
- Plus a little bit of hardware design of CPU etc.

Machine = Computing System

**Computer System Hierarchy**
- Application Software
  - High-level language (C)
- System Software
  - *Compiler*: translates HLL code to machine code
  - Memory, storage, input/output, tasks, resources
- System Hardware
  - Processor, memory, I/O controllers

### System Fundamentals
#### Representing Information

**Encoding**: Assign representation to information
- Numbers (base-2, base-8, base-10)
- Characters (ASCII or UNICODE => utf-8)

*Encoding is an art*
- Choosing an appropriate and efficient encoding is a real
  engineering challenge (and an art)
- Design impacted by:
  - **Complexity** (encoding difficulty)
  - **Efficiency** (# of bits used, transmit energy)
  - WE WANT: **Low complexity, high efficiency**

**Variable Encoding**
- Good for compression algorithms
- Complex and space efficient but not time-efficient

**Fixed Encoding**
- Not complex and not space efficient
- High-speed!!
- This is our foundation

*Need ceil[log2(M)] bits to represent M symbols in binary*
- Each bit can represent 2 symbols
- With two bits, you can represent 2^2 symbols, or 4
- With 8 bits, you can represent 2^8 symbols, or 256
- To represent 200 symbols, you need ceil[log2(200)]
  = ceil(7.64) = 8 bits
