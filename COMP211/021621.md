## Functions
Need a definition and then an initialization  
Define above main so it can be used in main and then add the
implementation below main  
```C
// Definition: Interface/Prototype
// Generally goes into a header file (.h) which is imported
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
  ...
}

// Initialization
// Generally goes into an implementation file (.c)
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Activation Record** - Stack (memory) frame with scope to a
specific function (*synonymous with stack frame*)  
Once a function has returned a value, the activation record
disappears and so do all of the variables local to that
record  
This is called the **Function Call Sequence**  

## Pointers
*Pointer* - An explicit memory address  
`int i;`
`i` is an integer value in memory  
It has an arbitrary address  
`int *p;`  
`*p` is pointing to an address location in memory  
`p = &i`  
`&` is the *address of operator*
So now `p` stores the memory address of `i`  
The *value* in `p` is equal to the *address* of `i`  
Passing by value is using `i`  
Passing by reference is using `p`  
`int *a = p;`  
`a` points to `p` which points to `i` so `a` points to `i`  
**Dereferencing:**
`int i = 12;`  
`int *p;`  
`p = &i;`  
`int c = *p;`  
Now `c` stores the value 12 because the `*` dereferences `p`  
```C
// Three new memory addresses holding a, b, c
int a = 5;
int b = 7;
int c = 9;

// p points to the memory address of c
int *p = &c;
// Dereference p and change the value to 10, so now c = 10
*p = 10;

// Change p to point to the memory address of a
int *p = &a;
// Dereference p and change the value to 21, so now a = 21
*p = 21;
```

Dereferencing can be done to an expression!  
`*(p+100)` dereferences the address location 100 ints after p  
SO:  
`int a[3] = {1,2,3};` creates an integer array starting at
some base address which is the same as `&a[0]`  
Then `a[1]` is the value `*(a+1)`  
When you initialize an array, the array variable is really
a **pointer** to the head of the array!!!  
SO:  
```C
int a[3] = {0,1,2};
int *p1 = a; // p1 points to the base address or a[0]
int *p2 = a + 1; // p2 points to the address of a[1]
```
*Pointers can be dangerous* - You have to be careful about
exceeding bounds  
This can happen with pointer arithmetic and C will *let you
do it*  
**Segmentation Fault** - Run-time error of referencing an
address location that you do not have access to
