### WORK ON THE PROJECT
Due May 5th  

## Process Termination
`exit()`  
When the child program finishes, it calls `exit()`  

**The exit system call:** takes the termination status of
the program as an argument (from PCB)  
Deallocates memory, heap stack, shared libs, data, text,
rodata, etc., but NOT PCB  
Deallocates most of the OS structures supporting the process  

### Process Table
Process table holds PIDs and their PCBs  
Basically the `proc` folder  

### The wait() system call
**Blocks** the parent until child finishes  
When a child calls `exit()`, OS unblocks the parent  
If there are no children alive, `wait()` returns immediately  

**What does the parent do?**  
Receives child termination status  
Update data structures in its PCB related to child processes
accordingly  
Performs a system call  
- Remove child from process table
- Remove remaining child PCB information  

**Do you think this could be exploited?**  
Fork bomb! Yay
