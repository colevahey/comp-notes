## Why Use Malloc
When you remove an activation record, the data remains in
memory until it is written over  
This is a problem! Because if you do not write over old
functions, you have a security risk because you can have
a pointer to data that should be out of scope  

When you use `malloc()`, you don't put variables in your stack
that can be written over. You put data in your **heap**  

This means that the data will not be overwritten!!  
BECAUSE when you allocate heap memory, this data does not
have *scope*  

To undo `malloc()`, use `free()` since C does not have
garbage collection  

## Quiz Review
Load is a read  
Store is a write
