## Memory Structure
#### Physical Memory  
**Main memory - RAM**  
Specifically *DRAM*  
Organized by address location  
How many address locations?  
**Amount of addressable space:**  
32 bits = 2^32 address locations â‰ˆ 4 billion address
locations  
Each location has a unique address given by the 32 bits in
binary  
Each location holds a byte  
So this is 4 billion bytes, or 4 Gigabytes of memory!!  

If you have 32 bits of main memory, all your buses will also
be 32 bits  
And the registers must be at least 32 bits  

**EXAMPLE:**  
4-bits of addressable space  
Each address stores 1 byte  
SO 16 (2^4) address locations  
And then since 1 byte per address, memory is 16 bytes total
