## Recitation Notes
`~(A+B)(C XOR D)`

### Full Adders & Half Adders
**HA** - Takes in one bit for A, one bit for B, and outputs
a Sum and a Carry  
```
S = A XOR B
C = AB
```

**FA** - Takes in one bit for A, one bit for B, and one bit
for Carry, and outputs a Sum and a Carry  

If you are just working with addition, always start with
a half adder  
Then chain full adders off of the half adder  

**To detect overflow, take the XOR of the carry outs of the
last two full adders**  

### Circuit Reduction
```
X = (~(AB))(B XOR ~C)
Y = C + AB
```
