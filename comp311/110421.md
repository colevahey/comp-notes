## Procedures Continued
**Contracts:**  
The *caller* will:  
1. Save in its stack frame all temporary registers that it
   wants to survive the upcoming call to the CALLEE
   ($t0-$t9, $a0-$a3, $v0-$v1)  
2. Pass the first 4 arguments in registers $a0-$a3 and save
   subsequent arguments on the stack (in reverse)

The *callee* will:  
1. Allocate a stack frame with space for saved registers,
   local variables, and spilled args  
2. Save any "saved registers" used ($ra, $sp, $s0-$s7)  
3. Place return values in $v0-$v1  
4. Restore saved registers  
5. Fix $sp to its original value
