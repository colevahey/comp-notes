## MORE MIPS
When a jump is performed, `$31` remains unchanged  

Whenever a jump and link (`jal`) is performed, `$31` saves the
return address of where the jump was performed from (+8
bytes to get to the next instruction with speed (more on
this later))

When a jump return (`jr`) is called, you stick the `ra` from
`$31` back into the pc  

`slt = set-if-less-than` - slt rd, rs, rt => `$rd = ($rs < $rt)`
`slti = set-if-less-than-immediatte` - slti rs, rt, i => `$rt = ($rs < i)`

### Operands
1. Immediate - `addi $8, $9, 10 => $8 = $9 + 10`  
2. Register - `add $8, $9, $0 => $8 = $0 + $9`  
3. Displacement - `lw $2, 12($28) => $2 = mem($28 + 12)`
