## Addressing Modes
Immediate (no Memory Access) => value = constant  
Absolute (or "Direct") => value = Mem[constant] `$t0 = Mem[32($0)]`  
Register-Indirect => Value = Mem[Reg[x]] `$t0 = Mem[0($t1)]`
Displacement => value = Mem[Reg[x] + const] `$t0 = Mem[32($t1)]`  
Pseudoinstruction => An instruction that is not in the
core instructions, but is caught by the assembler and translated
into the core instructions
