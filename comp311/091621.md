## Milen Lecture on SAP
**SAP:** 8-bit Computer  
 - 8-bit words
 - 8-bit instructions
 - Only 16 bytes of RAM (to keep every instruction to
   8 bits; 4 for instruction and 4 for address)  
 - Single program-accessible register: Reg A  

**B Reg** cannot be directly accessed, used to load memory
contents for second operand for ADD and SUB  
**Instruction register** holds the current instruction to
execute  
**Program Counter** holds the location of current/next
instruction (ONLY 4 BITS)  
**MAR (Memory Address Register)** is used for Memory reads
and writes (ONLY 4 BITS)  

### Instructions
SAP has *11* 4-bit instructions, most use register A  
4 bits contain the **op code** and 4 bits contain the
***argument***  

NOP => No Operation  
LDA MEM => Load A from Mem (A = Mem(arg))  
ADD MEM => Add Mem to A (A = A + Mem(arg))  
SUB MEM => Sub Mem from A (A = A - Mem(arg))   
STA MEM => Store A to Mem (Mem(arg) = A)  
LDI VAL => Load Immediate value to A (A = arg)  
JMP Instruction Address => Jump Address PC = Address (helps
with if/then statements)   
JC Instruction Address => Jump Carry (If Carry Flag = 1 then PC
= arg else go on; helps with loops)   
JZ Instruction Address => Jump Zero (If Zero Flag then PC
= arg else go on)  
OUT => Output Display = A  
HLT => Halt  

LDI is special: it takes a *4-bit* constant as an argument and stores it immediately in A  

*How are these instructions found?*  
**Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle**  
1. Fetch: Instruction Register = Mem(PC)
2. Increment PC
3. Decode instruction in Instruction Register (Takes place
   in Control)  
4. Execute that instruction  

**ADD Instruction: 5 Clock Cycles**  
1. PC Out, Memory Address Register in
2. RAM out, Instruction Register in, increment PC
3. Instruction Register out, MAR in 
4. RAM out, Reg B in
5. ALU out, Reg A in  

*Conditional Jump Instructions:*  
Jump on Carry and Jump on Zero  

Instruction Memory and Data Memory are the *SAME THING*  
They BOTH occur in RAM, just conventionally we write
Instruction Memory in early addresses, and then start Data
Memory from the last addresses  

SAP uses another register as an output register that
controls the 7-line segment display  
Displays 2's complement *decimal* value of OUT register
(which is loaded with the OUT op)
