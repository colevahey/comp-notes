## Sequential Logic
### Timing
**Regulating ALU Operations**  

**When do we know an operation is done?**  
An ALU is *stateless*, meaning that once a computation is
done, it is not saved within the circuitry. Output is
a combination of calculations on the inputs -- called
combinational logic  

**Sequential Logic Circuits:** Do not depend solely on the
input, but also past calculations, values stored in some
storage units (typically registers) and their outputs  
 - Addition of two variables
 - Printing out the time
 - Saving a calculation result for future use  

Sequential logic enables us to perform complex operations,
transforming our existing *calculator* ALU to a full-fledged
computer with memory  

### Sequential Logic
8-bit *register* made with 8 *flip-flops*  
1 *flip-flop* made with *2 latches*  
The 8-bit register makes this an **8-bit machine**  

### Latches
**Building block of a register**  
*D* in D-Latch stands for *Data* Latch  

**Positive Latch:** D, G => Q  
**Negative Latch:** D, ~G => Q  
Putting these two can give you a *flip-flop*
