## SAP Part 2
### Phase 1: Fetch (2 Clock Cycles)
Pull the first instruction from address 0 and move it to the
instruction register  
- Driven by incremented PC
- Reads line of RAM associated with PC (which is the address
  of the current instruction)
- Copies instruction from RAM into Instruction Register  
- Increments PC at the very end  

### Phase 2: Decode (0 Clock Cycles)
Control prepares system for execution by breaking down the
instruction (uses the OPCODE)

### Phase 3: Execute (3 Clock Cycles)
Run calculation and read/write value to appropriate memory
unit (RAM or registers)
- Performs read or write as dictated by instruction
- Performs addition/subtraction, writes resulting value back
  into register, etc, as dictated by instruction
- Set Zero/Overflow register for ALU operations
