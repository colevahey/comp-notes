## Building a "Simple as Possible" (SAP) Computer
Designed and implemented by [Ben

**Single Core CPUs:** CPUs with one ALU, one control unit,
and one set of registers  
*ALU*: Responsible for arithmetic operations  
*Registers*: Act like variables inside the processor  
*Control Unit*: Directs traffic between all other parts  
**We interact with data memory in two ways:**  
*Loading* - Pulling a value from memory into a register  
*Storing* - Saving a value from register or from input
elsewhere  

*Registers*:  
 - Can only save small # of numbers
 - Easy to read/write quickly
 - Can be used in ALU calculations
 - Data fits within register size  

*Data memory (RAM)*:  
 - Using an address, we can access a specific spot of the
   memory unit
 - **Random Access** means that every point of storage can
   be accessed at any time  

We are able to **save instructions** in memory  
A *Program Counter (PC)* tells us what line of instruction we
are on  
An instruction register holds an entire single, current
instruction  

The PC is incremented periodically (based on the clock)  
It is also incremented after every instruction is completed  
Each of the instruction pointed to will then be loaded into
the **instruction register**!

All of the lines going from one component to another can be
simplified and centralized with the use of a **BUS**  
**BUS:** Parallel electrical wires with multiple connections  
It is a ***concept*** - Physical wires that can go different
places in parallel  

Used by components to *communicate* with one another  
At any given time, a component must either:  
 - Read a value from the bus
 - Write a value to the bus
 - Be disconnected (electronically) from the bus  

Exactly one component puts its contents onto the bus, and
usually one component reads from the bus's contents at any
one time  

Every source connected to the bus must have a *tri-state
buffer* - (input/output/disconnect) are the three possible
states. Only one of the connections can be
inputting/outputting at any given time
