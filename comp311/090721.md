## Latches
Latches write and latch at two *different* times!  
This is why they are not precise enough to store data  
This is why we need D-Flip-Flops!  

## Flip Flops
With a rising edge (positive) flip flop, Q latches onto
D when a clock has a rising edge  

A POSITIVE D-Flip-Flop is created using a negative D-Latch
followed by a positive D-Latch  
The only difference between these latches is that the clock
signal is inverted for the first (negative) latch  
Then the output from the first latch is fed as the input
Q into the second latch
