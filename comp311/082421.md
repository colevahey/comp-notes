### Quiz 1 Thursday!
IN CLASS, closed book, on paper, sit in assigned seat  
Study last semester's quiz on the same subject  

## Combinational Logic
Digital abstraction gives meaning to voltage in current  
0V - 0.5V = Logical 0 "good signal"  
0.5V - 1.5V = Logical 0 "poor signal" but still ok  
1.5V - 3.5V = ILLEGAL signal, no guarantee whether circuit
will interpret as 1 or 0  
3.5V - 4.5V = Logical 1 "poor signal" bus still ok  
4.5V - 5V = Logical 1 "good signal"  

Many chips will convert the poor input voltages to strong
output voltages (i.e. 0V - 1.5V => 0V - 0.5V OR 3.5V - 5V =>
4.5V - 5V)  

**For binary addition, be careful to catch overflow! It can
only occur between two numbers with the same sign (+/-)**  

**Word** definitions vary across systems - Many of ours are
64-bits, but we will study mostly 32-bit words  

**Logic Gates:** Physical electronic devices that implement
a Boolean function, taking inputs and relaying outputs via
"wire"  

**COMBINATIONAL SYSTEMS:** Depend on inputs alone!  
**SEQUENTIAL SYSTEMS:** Depend on inputs and their sequence!  
Sequential systems almost always need clocks to keep track
of sequencing of events  

The classic *combinational system* is the **ALU**  
The ALU traditionally takes two inputs paired with an
operation and outputs a result  

Combinational Logic is *stateless*, i.e. it performs
a calculation but doesn't save the output  
Calculations are completed within a **cycle**, a given time
period determined ahead of time for the system (Gigahertz
processing speed)  

### Gates
The simplest combinational gate is an **inverter** (the
bubble)  
One input and one output, it inverts 1 to 0 or 0 to 1  

AND gates are similar, but half ovals  
OR gates are similar, but more beaked  

A NAND gate is an AND gate with an inverter at the output  
XOR is the OR but with a line at the back of the beak  

Already know **sum of products**  
Get more practice factoring out inputs  

(~A)BC + A(~B)(~C) + AB(~C) + ABC = BC + A(~C)
