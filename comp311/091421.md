## Lecture Notes
**Bus:** Control has the flags to enable write and
read in components (xIn/xOut) called control lines

ONLY ONE register can write to the bus at any time  
*Usually* only one register reads from the bus at any time  

**Machine Code:** Lowest level of code a human could write
on a machine  
**Microcode:** The set of bits in control memory that
*implement* machine code! We do not have access to these  

High Level Language -> Machine Code -> Microcode
