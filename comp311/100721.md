## MIPS Introduction
MIPS => Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages  
RISC Instruction Set Architecture => Reduced Instruction Set
Computer - Aimed to minimize number of clock cycles spent
per instruction  

MIPS is special in that there is only **1 clock cycle
per instruction**  

**MIPS:**  
Memory reads and writes in 32-bit words  
You can also access memory at the byte level  
Data path is 32 bits wide; registers 32 bits wide; ALU
calculates 32 bits (except multiply)  
Byte-level addressing useful for character operations, etc  

MIPS has **strict separation** between instructions that
access memory and all other instructions  
Only instructions that access Memory (RAM) are Read from RAM
and Write to RAM  
All other instructions only access ***registers***  

THE PC **ALWAYS** HAS `00` IN THE TWO LEAST SIGNIFICANT BITS
TO MAKE SURE THAT BYTES ARE STORED IN A BYTE ADDRESS THAT IS
A MULTIPLE OF 4!!!  


**Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):**  
Offer tradeoffs on performance and compactness, but MIPS is
a good example of solid design and art
