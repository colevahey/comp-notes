### Recitation Notes
**Bus:** A collection of wires that multiple components can
connect to, as a means to read and write to the bus  

Only **one** source can write to the bus at any time, but
**any** amount of destinations can read from the bus at any
time  

**Tri-State Buffer Chip:** Looks like a IC, but serves as
a buffer for bus inputs  
Top 8 connections go to the bus, and bottom 8 go to the
component  
Three states for the tri-state buffer:  
 - Read
 - Write
 - Disconnected  
**Each** component connected to the bus needs a tri-state
buffer on the connection  

**MAR: Memory Address Register**  
Holds address to the place in ram to read or write to  
4-bit addresses means an 8-bit MAR that is ONLY connected to
the 4 least significant bits on the Bus  
MAR takes in a clock signal and a MI (MAR In) signal  

So first write the address to the bus and MAR take it in  
THEN put the result on the Bus and write to RAM or put RAM
data at the address on MAR on the Bus  

**RAM: Random Access Memory**  
Inputs: RI (RAM In), RO (RAM Out), MAR (Memory Address
Register), TSB that reads from the bus or writes to the bus
