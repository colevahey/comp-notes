## Performance
Loosely - How *fast* can a computer complete a task  

Elapsed Time/Wall Clock Time:  
 - Counts everything (disk and memory accesses, I/O, etc)
 - Includes the impact of other programs
 - A useful number, but often not good for comparisons  

> X is *n* times faster than Y  
Y/X - 1 = n
