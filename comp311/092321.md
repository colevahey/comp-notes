**The bus is controlled/written by tri-state buffers**  
Every component can Read, Write, and Disconnect with the bus  

Assembly language is the lowest level programming language,
and is *usually* one-to-one with the machine code  
There always has to be an **assembler** that translates
assembly code to machine code  

Microcode is what exists on the control, and is burned
into the machine (it is **hardware** only)  
Microcode is stored in *Read Only Memory* as one big table  

### Control
*9-bit* input which give the specific **ROM ADDRESS** for the current
control!!!

Two flag bits, four opcode bits, three step number bits
(counter)  
These are fed in as address space to our control memory,
each one produces the appropriate settings for the 16
control lines  
Flags ***only matter*** for opcode JC and JZ  

Step counter is incremented on clock falling edge
