## Adders
Adding is not a single operation  
We need two outputs: the sum and the carry bit, if the
result is longer than 1 bit long  
A full adder has a carry bit as an input as well  

Three possibilities:  
 - 0 + 0 = 0
 - 0 + 1 OR 1 + 0 = 1
 - 1 + 1 = 10 (0 and 1 carry bit)  

USING GATES for the HALF ADDER:  
```
SUM = A XOR B = (~AB + A~B)
CARRY = AB
```  

Now we need to make full adders  
We need to account for a carry *in*  

```
SUM = (A XOR B) XOR C
CARRY = AB + C(A XOR B)
```
