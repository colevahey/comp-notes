### Adders Cont.
A 32-bit ripple adder works with 1 half adder and then 31
full adders chained to it  
This design is *simple* but it may take a long time to get
the final result due to the **"ripple carry"**  
**Ripple Carry:** Each full adder must wait to do the
arithmetic until it gets the carry from the previous adder  

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
**THE CENTRAL PART OF THE CPU**  
Looking at the ALU, we want to be able to add 2 numbers, and
subtract 1 number  

Selection:  
 - 0 for addition
 - 1 for subtraction
 - 10 for multiplication, and 11 for shift later  

Status:
 - S1 for carry in for operation  
 - So for overflow  

TO SUBTRACT: A - B = A + (-B)  
So negate B (flip every bit and add 1)  
Then add the negative B to A

To create a subtraction circuit:  
1. Use all full adders for the circuit  
2. Negate (with an inverter) all of the bits coming in for the negative number  
3. Make the rightmost adder a FULL ADDER, that brings
   a carry-in  

### Adder and Subtracter
HAVE A CONTROL BIT  
At every adder, use `B XOR C` so that B gets inverted for
subtraction (C = 1)  
Also bring the `C` bit into the carry in!!  

### Detecting Zero and Overflow
**Zero:** Put all of the sum bits through a NOR gate, so
that only when all the bits are 0 the NOR is true  
**Overflow:** Put the last Full Adder's CI and CO through an
XOR gate. When these two bits are different, there is
overflow because this implies two positives added to return
a negative *OR* two negatives added to return a positive
