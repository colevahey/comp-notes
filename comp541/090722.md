## Transistors
AND - Series  
OR - Parallel

### Transmission Gate
Both pmos and nmos connected between input A and output B  
Acts like a simple switch between A and B  
~En connected to pmos and En connected to nmos so that both
are enabled when they need to be, and both off when they
need to be  

**Power = Energy / Time**  
Dynamic power consumption  
Static power consumption  

**Dynamic Power Consumption**  
Energy consumed due to switching activity  
All wires and transistor gates have capacitance  
Energy required to change a capacitance, C, to voltage, V,
is CV^2  
Circuit running at frequency f means capacitor is charged
f/2 times per second  
SO `POWER(dynamic) = 1/2*CV^2*f`  

**Static Power Consumption**  
Power consumed when no gates are switching  
Caused by the *quiescent supply current I* (also called the
*leakage current*)  
`POWER(STATIC or LEAKAGE) = IV` (where V is the supply
voltage)  

```
EXAMPLE:
V = 1.2 V
C = 20 nF
f = 1 GHz
I = 20mA

Total Power Consumption:
Dynamic Power Consumption = 1/2 * 20 * 1.2^2 * 1 = 14.4 W
Static Power Consumption = 20 * 01.2 = 24 mW
