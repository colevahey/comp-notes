## Memories and Timing
### Flip-Flops
**Only difference between a flip-flop and a latch in
diagrams is the triangle on clock input**  

**Register:**  
Multiple flip-flops together, to save a multi-bit value  
Pretty much synonymous with flip-flop, just understood to
hold more than one bit  

### Verilog Descriptions
**Carefully determine if a variable needs to  be:**  
`logic` type  
Only declare if it is only updated at discrete instants
(*clock*)  
Only when storage/flip-flops are required  

Or `wire` type  
If combinational, best to declare `wire` type  

### Delays and Timing
**Delay Models:**  
*Delay* = Time from input change to output change  
Usually measured from 50% point of change in timing diagram  

**Transport Delay:** Pure delay; Whatever goes in, comes out
after a specified amount of time  
**Inertial Delay:** Inputs have an effect only if they
persist for a specified amount of time  
No effect if input changes and changes back in too short
a time (can't overcome gate inertia)  
Can filter out glitches
