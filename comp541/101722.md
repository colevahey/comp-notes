## Memories
**Non-Volatile Memories:**  
EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) => Flash Memory  
Used almost everywhere now, even SSDs are flash memory  

**How do Flash and SSDs work?**  
Take a normal transistor and add a *float gate* between the
substrate and the normal control gate  
With voltage on the control gate, the value will stick to
whatever it is on the source line  
With a high negative voltage on the control gate, the
electrons jump back through the insulating substrate and the
location loses its value  

**For frequent writing, use *RAM***  
Reading and writing typically  controlled by "handshakes"  
Clock may still be present, but actions controlled by
handshake signals  

SRAM -> Easier to use, uses transistors (like latches),
faster, larger area per bit, more expensive per bit, used
for small fast storage like processor caches  
DRAM -> Stores charge in capacitor, disappears after short
period of time, must be refreshed, smaller area per bit,
cheaper per bit, use for bulk storage like processor main
memory  

SRAM memory cells use just 6 transistors
