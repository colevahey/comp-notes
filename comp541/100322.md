## Sequential Circuits and Storage Elements
Pipelining is a useful form of sequential logic  

### Storage Elements
**Types:**  
Latch, flip-flop, etc.  

**Need feedback to hold a value**  
Stabilization with feedback of certain values  

**SR Latch:** Stands for Set/Reset latch  
Stores one bit of state (Q)  
Q depends on S(set) and R(reset), settles on a 1 or
0 depending on NAND or NOR setup  

**D Latch:** Eliminate illegal state of SR Latch  
Ensure that "set" and "reset" cannot be simultaneously
asserted  
Simply have one input called D (data)  
S = D, R = D'  
Add a control input (clk) to decide when the state should change  
When clock is 0, D is ignored and Q is held  
When clock is 1, Q = D  

**D Flip Flop:** Q can only change on a positive clock edge  
Either first latch or second latch is enabled, but never
both  
L1 typically controlled by CLK' and L2 by CLK (Positive edge
FF)
