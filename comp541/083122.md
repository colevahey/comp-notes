## Intermediate Values
### X Value
Neither a 1 nor 0  
Represents unknown or illegal values  
For example, referencing an uninitialized value in
a simulator  
OR if you don't care, the output will be specified as an X  
Also X if the output is illegal (short circuit)  

### Z Value
Also neither 1 nor 0 - but *floating*  
Output is neither connected to 0 nor to 1  
Actual voltage is highly susceptible to noise  
Useful in buses, memories, multiplexers, etc  
For example, tristate buffer  

## Transistors and All That
At an abstract level, transistors are merely switches  
They make and break connections  
Switch controlled electrically  

*n-type*: Conduct when control input is 1  
*p-type*: Conduct when control input is 0  

*p*MOS has bubble  

### Silicon as a semiconductor
**Transistors are built from silicon**  
Pure silicon does not conduct well. It only conducts well if
it manufactured a certain way (hence semiconductor)  
Silicon stabilizes in a crystallized structure, like carbon  

Impurities are added to make it conducting  
Arsenic provides free electrons in the lattice -> n-type  
Boron provides free "holes" in the lattice -> p-type  

### MOS Transistors
**MOS**: Metal-oxide semiconductor  
3 terminals  
gate: the voltage here controls whether current flows  
source and drain: are what the current flows between  
Structurally, source and drain are the same  

**KEY IDEA**  
When the gate supplies current, electrons are not randomly
diffused around the substrate  
The electrons gather close to where the gate supplies the current,
which allows current to flow through them between the source and drain  

nMOS pass good 0s, but bad 1s  
pMOS pass good 1s, but bad 0s  

Typically use them in a complementary fashion  
nMOS network at the bottom (pull output value down to 0)  
pMOS network at the top (pull output value up to 1)  

ONLY ONE OF THE NETWORKS MUST CONDUCT AT A TIME  
If neither network conducts -> output will be floating
