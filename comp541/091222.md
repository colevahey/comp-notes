Sync Polarity - 1: Hsync is normally 1 and then pulses 0 for
the hsync  

`assign hsync = x < wholeLine - hBackPorch - 1 ? x < wholeLine - hBackPorch - hPulse - 1 ? hPolarity : !hPolarity : hPolarity`  
`assign hsync = y < wholeFrame - vBackPorch - 1 ? y < wholeFrame - vBackPorch - vPulse - 1 ? vPolarity : !vPolarity : vPolarity`  
`assign activevideo = x < hVisible && y < vVisible ? 1 : 0`  

### Logic Synthesis and Minimization
**Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps)**  
Graphical method for simplifying boolean equations  
Work well for up to 4 variables  
Help for quickly combining terms based on visual inspection  
REMEMBER TO LAY OUT THE TABLE GRAYCODE (00, 01, 11, 10)  

Give you a way of combining based on sum of products with
neighbors in the table  
Remember that the edges of the table wrap around, so the
first column and last column are neighbors, for example  

**RULES:**  
Use the fewest circles necessary to cover *all* the 1s  
A circle must not contain any 0s  
Each circle must span a *rectangular block* that is a power of
2 (1, 2, 4)  
Each circle should be as large as possible  
A circle may wrap around the edges of the K-map  
A 1 in a K-map may be circled *multiple times* if needed  

Don't Cares in a truth table (X) can be circled to help grab
more 1s
