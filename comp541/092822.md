## FSMs Continued
**Moore vs. Mealy**  
Mealy is more general  
*Every* Moore machine is automatically a special-case Mealy
machine  

Moore machines do not define outputs on arrows, they exist
based on the states ONLY  
Mealy machines define outputs on the arrows, since the
arrows give the input and previous state combination to define
the output  

To convert Moore to Mealy, move the state outputs to the
arrows that come out of the states  
To convert Mealy to Moore, you have to completely redraw the
state diagram  

Mealy usually gives a smaller circuit
