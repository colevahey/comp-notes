## Datapath and Single-Cycle MIPS
`000000` opcode for R-Type instructions (use 6 funct bits)  
For control lines, set `op | rs | rt | rd | shamt | funct`  
In assembly, remember code looks like `add rd, rs, rt`  

I-Type instructions have a 16-bit imm value  
For control lines, set `op | rs | rt | imm`  
In assembly, code looks like `addi rt, rs, imm`  

J-Type instructions have a 26-bit addr value  
For control lines, set `op | addr`
