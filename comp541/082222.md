## Combinational Logic - Logic Gates
All gates will clean up the signal before transmitting  
Multiple input gates have the inputs appended to the end:
For example `NOR3` or `AND4`  

**NAND is Universal** - Can express any Boolean Function  
Inverter -> NAND the input with itself  
AND -> NAND + Inverter  
OR -> Invert both inputs + NAND  

**DeMorgan's Law:** ~(AB) = ~A + ~B  

Sum or product -> AB + CD  
AND - OR is the *SAME* as NAND - NAND  
In a circuit, this is very useful since NAND gates are
easier to construct  

**NOR is ALSO Universal** - Can also express any boolean
function  
Inverter -> NOR the input with itself  
Others come out of the same sequence as NAND  

### Binary Abstraction
Define discrete voltages to represent 1 and 0  
For example, define ground as 0 and 5v as 1  

Define a *range* of voltages to represent 1 and 0  
Define the ranges to account for noise (anything that
degrades the signal)  

*The Static Discipline* - Given logically valid inputs, every circuit element must produce logically valid outputs  

**Noise Margin** - Amount of tolerable noise between worst
output voltage and the worst input voltage  
*Every gate will send out values cleaner than the ones that
they receive*  
If the inputs are well-behaved (in range), the outputs will always be
cleaner than the inputs  

As technology has improved, VDD for transistors has dropped  
5.0V -> 3.3V -> 2.5V -> 1.8V -> 1.5V -> 1.2V -> 1.0V -> ...
