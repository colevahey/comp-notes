## Verilog: Simulation vs Synthesis
**Simulation:**  
You describe the circuit in Verilog  
Simulate it  
Good for - testing whether your conceptual design works before
you spend money getting it fabricated  
**Synthesis:**  
You describe the behavior in Verilog  
Use a compiler to create a circuit for you  
Good for - describing large-scale complex systems without
ever manually building them  

### Variables with memory
*logic and reg types*  
Indicates value that may need to be held  
Allowed to be updated at discrete instants *vs* a wire that
is continuously assigned  

We will use log in SystemVerilog because registers are
sometimes optimized away by the compiler  

Logic variables updated continuously, then they act as
combinational circuits (same as a wire)  
Logic could be both combinational or sequential then  

### Logic Variable Declaration
For sporadic (discrete) updates - specify events that
trigger an update  
```
logic [31:0] count = 32'b0; // 32-bit binary 0
always_ff @(posedge clock) // Could also be negedge, use one of the two
  count <= count + 1'b1; // 1-bit binary 1
```
