## Debouncing
Debouncing can be done using analog circuits or digital
circuits  
We will design a digital debouncer  

**Debouncer functionality:**  
Cleans u[ bounces or chatter on inputs  
input `raw` bounces several times before settling  
output `clean` changes only after `raw` has settled for a while  

On clock, check the raw input  
If raw is consistently different from current output, then
update the output  

Keep a count of the number of times the input differs from
the output  
If the input becomes the same as the output, reset the
counter to 0  
Once the counter reaches a limit, change the output to the
current input (this is stable)
