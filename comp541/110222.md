## Multicycle MIPS
**Program Execution Time** = IC x CPI x Tc  
Instruction Count x Cycles per Instruction x Cycle Time  
Tc is limited by the *critical path* (`lw`)  
`lw` is typically the longest instruction (in clock cycles)  

### Multicycle MIPS
Higher clock speed  
Simpler instructions run faster  
Reuse expensive hardware on multiple cycles  
Some sequencing overhead though  

**Replace Instruction and Data memories with a single
unified memory**  
More realistic to buy one big RAM  
Was not possible in single-cycle implementation (since you
may have to read and write to both at the same time)  
Now you can use the same memory in different clock cycles  

### Step 1: Fetch Instruction
Introduce instruction register to buffer this instruction  
A non-architectural register (ie not accessible to the
programmer)  

### Step 2: A is read from register file and immediate is sign extended  
A is another non-architectural register  
No need to add another register after the sign extension  

### Step 3: ALU computes
Insert another register to buffer ALUOut  

### Step 4: Same memory read now for data access
Insert a multiplexer in front of the memory's address input  
Choose either PC or ALUOut as address  

### Step 5: Data from memory is written into register file
Final step in the `lw` instruction  

IF -> RF -> ALU -> DM -> WB/PC
