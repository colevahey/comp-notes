## Video Displays
**How do monitors work?**  
Origin is TV, so let's look at that  
LCDs work on different principle, but all signaling was
derived from 1940s TVs  

Monitors rely on our brain to do two things:  
*Integrate over space*  
*Integrate over time*  
Discrete pixels and frames depend on us to see something
smooth and continuous  

Video and movies are a series of stills  
If they go fast enough, your brain interprets moving imagery  
50-60 Hz minimum to not see a flicker  
1 Hz is once per second  

**LCD Monitors internally work very differently**  
No beams or tubes, tiny mirrors that allow light through or
send it out of the way  

**VGA is totally analog, not digital**  
Each number (rrrrggggbbbb) is equivalent to a different
analog color  
You must supply hsync and vsync pulses to tell the monitor when to
reset horizontally and vertically  
The monitor will lock onto the timing  

Synchronizing pulses occur between front and back porch for
the visible screen
