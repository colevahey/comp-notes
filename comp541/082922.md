## Sum of Products
**Terminal** -> A or ~A  
**Product Term** -> ABC or ~ABC or B~C...  

**Minterm** -> Product term in which all variables appear
once (complemented or not)  
There is exactly one minterm per row of a truth table  
For example: x = 0, y = 0, z = 1 translates to minterm ~X~YZ  

**Maxterm** -> Sum term in which all variables appear once
(complemented or not)  
There is exactly one maxterm per row of a truth table  
For example: x = 0, y = 0, z = 1 translates to X + Y + ~Z  
Translates to a 1 everywhere except that specific row  

Complement of a function:  
Swap all of the 1s and 0s in the truth table  

Product of Maxterms:  
M1 * M2 * M3  
Works like sum of products, but more like product of sums  
Basically assume output = 1, look for any of the zero rows
with the OR combination giving a 0 as well  

Sum of products -> AND-OR -> NAND-NAND implementation  
Product of sums -> OR-AND -> NOR-NOR implementation  

### Circuit Schematic Rules
Wires connect where there is a dot on overlapping lines  
Wires always connect at a T junction
