## Specifying Memories in SystemVerilog
### Overview of ROM and RAM
**ROM => Read-Only Memory**  
Memory that is permanent  
Often the data is "baked into" during fabrication  
There are ROM flavors that allow updates (PROM, EEPROM, etc)  
Updates are typically  infrequent or sporadic  

Top-level view:  
*k* address lines  
*2^k* data locations  
*n* bits of data at each location  
***2^k x n ROM***  

**RAM => Random Access Memory (Read-Write Memory)**  
Allows reads and writes with similar speeds  
Allows for random access as opposed to sequential access  

Top-level view:  
*k* address lines  
*2^k* data locations (one word each)  
*n* bits of data/location  
data input as well  

Also need a line to specify reading or writing  
Typically  only  one wire needed, sometimes two separate
ones  

### System Verilog
**RAM Example**  
Single-ported -> one address for reading and writing  
Whether read or written is determined by "write enable" (wr)  
Clock input, all writes take place on  clock tick  
Reads are asynchronous, output  automatically after
propagation display  

```
logic [Dbits - 1:0] mem [Nloc-1:0]; // Array of [Dbits - 1:0] logic type with Nloc elements called mem
always_ff @(posedge clock)
  if (wr) mem[addr] <= din;

assign dout = mem[addr];
```
*Dbits => data bits*  
*Nloc => number of locations*  

For more locations in the RAM, add assign statements for
different *douts* at each read address  

Register location 0 must always return the value 0. Have to
check in a conditional in System Verilog  

`initial $readmemh("mem_data.mem", mem, 0, Nloc-1);`  
`mem` initialized with the data from file `mem_data`  
Initialize it with data from line 0 through Nloc - 1  

For ROM, you just need to assign `dout = mem[addr];` after
the mem initialization and readmemh just like for RAM  
No need to have clock-tick writes for ROM  

### VGA Output
Use 16x16 for sprite sizes
