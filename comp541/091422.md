## Decoders
N input wires, 2^N output wires  
Only one output is HIGH at any given time  

### Building a 3-8 Decoder
Use two 2-4 Decoders  
Send one of the 3 inputs as an enable bit to both 2-4s  
One of them negated  
Basically halves the problem depending on the enable input  

### Building a N+1 - 2^(N+1) Decoder
Take TWO of the N-2^N decoders  
Decode the N+1 bit that does not fit and decode it by itself  
Use it to enable or disable the two N-2^N decoders  

## Demultiplexer
Send data to one output based on given inputs  
Same as a decoder, but instead of setting output to 1, set
output to given data  

## Encoder
2^N input wires, N output wires
