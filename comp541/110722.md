## Multicycle MIPS Continued
**Every instruction starts by *fetching* the instruction and
incrementing PC by 4**  
```
IorD = 0
AluSrcA = 0
AluSrcB = 01
AluOp = 00
PCSrc = 0
IRWrite
PCWrite
```  

**The next stage is *decode*, where no control lines are
required, everything just progresses to the next registers
(A & B)**  

HOWEVER, in cycle 2, we calculate the branch target,
REGARDLESS of the instruction  
This result will be discarded if it is I-type or R-type, but
if it is a branch, then this saves a later cycle!  

For jumps, assign `PC <= {pcPlus4[31:28], instr[25:0]<<2}`  
This makes sense for multicycle mips, since PC is
incremented by 4 in the first clock cycle!  

**Instructions take different numbers of cycles:**  
3 cycles - beq, j  
4 cycles - R-type, sw, addi  
5 cycles - lw  

CPI is the weighted average of these instructions  
25% loads, 10% stores, 11% branches, 2% jumps, 52% R-type  
Average CPI = (0.11 + 0.02)\*3 + (0.52+0.10)\*4 + (0.25)\*5 = 4.12  

```
Tc = tpcq + tmux + max(tALU + tmux, tmem) + tsetup
```  
PREP THIS FOR EXAM ^^  
*Sequencing overhead is tpcq + tsetup, the amount of time
necessary for the registers in multicycle mips*
