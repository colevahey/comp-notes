## Boolean Algebra
Digital circuits made up of subcircuits or components of
elements  
Connected by wires  
Wires and terminals often called "nodes"  

### Types of Circuits
**Combinational Circuit**  
Output depends only on the current values of the inputs  
Output does not depend on past inputs or outputs
(memory-less)  
You know exactly what the output will be just from current
inputs  
Example: *AND gate*  

Theorem -  A circuit is combinational *if*:  
Every element is itself combinational  
Every node is either designated as an input, or connects to
exactly one output terminal of an element (two wires from
outputs cannot just connect)  
Contains no cyclic paths  

Even if one of these criteria is violated, the circuit may
still be combinational  

Topographical sort of combinational elements:  
Outputs only depend on inputs coming in, always from the
previous level  
Cannot sort topographically if there exists a cycle  

**Sequential Circuit**  
Output depends on not only current inputs, but also past
behavior  
Has "memory", or is "stateful"  
Example: *Counter*  
Will discuss more later  

### Boolean Algebra
Don't forget that X+YZ = (X+Y)(X+Z)  
To find the complement of an output, flip all of the
operators and then complement the inputs  

```
F = ~XYZ + ~XY~Z + XZ
F = ~X(YZ + Y~Z) + XZ
F = ~X(Y(Z + ~Z)) + XZ
F = ~XY + XZ
```  
Consensus Theorem:  
XY + ~XZ + YZ = XY + ~XZ  
(X + Y)(~X + Z)(Y + Z) = (X + Y)(~X + Z)
