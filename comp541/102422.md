## Memory III
SRAM is used when you need fast, expensive stories (caches)  
DRAM is used when you need bulk storage (traditional RAM)  

SRAM is usually in the MB range for modern computers  
DRAM is usually 8 or 16 GB  

Usually SRAM cache and the CPU are actually put on the same
chip to maximize speed  

SRAM has large locations, stable, secure, and does NOT need refreshes  
DRAM is large in total size, unstable, and needs refreshing!  

DRAM has to worry about the number of input/output pins  
DRAM saves pins by making its wires bidirectional  
Also saves pins by using same wires (address lines) for row and column
addresses  
Sends row address and then later sends col address on the
same wires  

**SDRAM => Synchronous DRAM**  
Has a clock  
Common type in PCs late-90s  
Multiple *banks* of chips (for more locations)  
Pipelined -> Start read in one bank after another  
Come back and read the resulting values one after another  

**DDR DRAM => Double Data Rate (DDR) SDRAM**  
Transfers data on both edges of the clock  
Clock only has to be half as fast  
Good because high-speed clocks are hard to design  
Currently the most popular standard
