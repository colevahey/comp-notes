## Memories II
**DRAM:**  
Very lightweight bit-level memory  
A single capacitor holds charge (= value)  
A single transistor acts as gate  

DRAM cell consists of *one* transistor and *one* capacitor  
SRAM cell has at least six transistors  
SRAM keeps the value super clean, whereas DRAM uses the
capacitor which tends to be leaky with the data voltage  

DRAM utilizes *destructive reads*  
When a cell is read, charge is (partially) removed  
It must be restored after each read!  
There is also steady leakage so charge must be restored
periodically anyway
