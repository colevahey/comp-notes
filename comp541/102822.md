## Final Project Intro
**Simple technique for accessing I/O**  
Each device is assigned its own range in memory (address
space)  
CPU then reads and writes to the specific range of memory
which the I/O devices use  

### Final Project Memory Configuration
Using MARS assembler (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)  

**Instruction Memory**  
In MARS, starts at `0x0040_0000`  
Our instruction memory starts at `0x0`  
We will simply drop the upper 20 bits, and the lowest 2 bits
from the PC so that PC + 4 goes to IMEM + 1  
Now we go from PC => `0x0040_0000 -> 0x0040_0FFC` for 1024
instructions  

**Data Memory (0x1001...)**  
Memory addresses between `0x1001_0000` and `0x1001_0FFC` will
route to data memory, to be written or read  

**Screen Memory (0x1002...)**  
Memory addresses between `0x1002_0000` and `0x1002_1280`
will route to screen memory, writing out each sprite
location (`40x30 = 1200` total locations)  
CHANGE FROM LAB 7: Now a 2-port RAM instead of ROM, so you
can write to the memory from the CPU  

**IO DEVICES (0x1003...)**  
**Keyboard**  
Memory address `0x1003_0000` will hold the input from the
keyboard I/O  
**Accelerometer**  
Memory address `0x1003_0004` will hold the input from the
accelerometer I/O  
**Sound**  
Memory address `0x1003_0008` will route to sound output and
can be written by the CPU  
**LEDs**  
Memory address `0x1003_000C` will route to the LED lights
and can be written by the CPU  

Check the two bits holding the 0x100**1**xxxx, 0x100**2**xxxx, or
0x100**3**xxxx to determine whether to go to data mem, screen
mem, or IO devices
