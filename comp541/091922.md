## Sequential Logic
### Finite State Machines
**Sequential Logic Circuits:** Output is determined not only
by current inputs  
*State* = information stored/memorized  

**Finite State Machine:** Machines that process a sequence
of events  
Each event may cause a state change  
Output is essentially a function of the sequence of inputs
processed thus far  

**Synchronous (clocked) FSMs**  
Flip-flops/registers contain the system's state  
State changes only at clock edge  
All flip-flops receive the *same clock signal*  
Ever cyclic path must contain a flip-flop  

**Moore FSM:** Outputs depend ONLY on the current state  
**Mealy FSM:** Outputs depend on the current state AND the
inputs  
*In both, next state is determined by current state AND
inputs*  

### Sequential Logic (Verilog)
Use `always_ff @(posedge clk)`  
Use nonblocking assignments (`<=`)  
Do not make assignments to the same signal in more than one
`always_ff` block  

### Combinational Logic (Verilog)
Use continuous assignments (`assign ...`) whenever readable  
OR use `always_comb`  
All variables must be assigned in every situation!  
Must have a `default` case in case statement  
Must have a closing `else` in an if statement  
Do not make assignments to the same signal in more than one
`always_comb` or assign statement
