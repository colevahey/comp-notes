## Input/Output Devices
**Keyboard Interface**  
PS/2 used to be the dominant keyboard protocol  
*PS/2 = a synchronous serial protocol*  
Each symbol is transmitted bit-by-bit  
8 data bits + 3 control bits  
Synchronized to the keyboard's clock (PS/2 clock)  

One bit of data sent every falling edge of PS/2 clock  
Idle bit is 1  

**On keypress:**  
First clock tick goes to 0  
Eight clock ticks send the key data (LSB to MSB)  
One clock tick to send parity bit  
One stop bit sent  

Keycodes are sent at one byte each  
A code is sent on keypress and on keyrelease  
FOR EXAMPLE: `space keypress -> 29; space keyrelease -> F0 29`
