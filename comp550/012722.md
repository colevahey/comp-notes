## Divide and Conquer
**Divide the problem into a number of subproblems**  
Sometimes just two subproblems, not always  
Subproblems definitely smaller  
**Conquer the subproblems**  
Call recursively or work together  
**Combine the subsolutions**  

### Merge Sort
**Divide:** Separate the sequence into about two equal halves  
**Conquer:** Call merge sort on the two subsequences  
**Combine:** Merge the two sorted subsequences  
Recurrence Relation:  
```
T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/2) + n
Theta(nlg(n))
```  

### Methods to Solve Recurrence Relations
1. Substitution Method - Guess the bound and solve
2. Change the Variables Method - Substitute a function for
   a variable
3. Recurrence-tree (Iteration) Method - Use summation to
   solve the recurrence  
4. Master Method - Standardized way to analyze then prove  

**Make sure to review chapter 4 for all of this**  

### Substitution Method
Guess the form of the solution and then check it  
For some T(n) guess cg(n) then substitute it in  
`T(n) T(n/2) + n` becomes `T(n) = cg(n/2) + n`  
T(n) resolves to cg(n) plus some remainder  

If remainder lim(n->infinity):  
+- infinity -> LittleOmega(g(n)) or LittleOh(g(n))  
small positive constant then BigOmega(g(n))  
small negative constant then BigOh(g(n))
If for some c:  
small positive constant in one case and small negative 
constant in other case, then Theta(g(n))  

```
Solve: T(n) = 3T(floor(n/3)) + n
1. Guess T(n) = cnlg(n)
2. T(n) = 3T(n/3) + n = 3cg(n/3) + n = 3c(n/3)lg(n/3) + n
3. T(n) = cn(lg(n) - lg(3)) + n
4. T(n) = cn(lg(n)) - cn(lg(3)) + n
5. T(n) = cn(lg(n)) - n(clg(3) - 1)
6. T(n) = our guess, g(n) = cnlg(n) plus remainder

For large n, remainder is small relative to guess
n(1-clg(3))/(nlg(n)) => 0
Negative when c > 1/lg(3)
Positive when c < 1/lg(3)
T(n) = Theta(nlg(n)) when c1 = c2 = 1/lg(3)
```
