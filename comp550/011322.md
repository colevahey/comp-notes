### Devising Algorithms
**Seven Steps**  
1. Work an example
2. Write down exactly what you did
3. Generalize - need multiple examples
4. Test algorithm
5. Write code
6. Debug code
7. Test code  

### Algorithm Speed
If computers were infinitely fast, no one would care about
algorithm speed  
However, speed is always a practical concern
