## Parsing
### Top-Down Parsing
Simulate the CFG - input w is read from left to right  
Parse stack is initialized with start symbol S  
Repeat until parse stack is empty or input is exhausted  
If the top of the parse stack is terminal b and b matches
the next input symbol, pop from stack
and advance to the next symbol. Otherwise parse error  
If top of parse stack is a nonterminal A, predict correct
rule A ::= a from grammar G  
Pop A and push a  
**w elementof L(G) iff stack empty and input exhausted**  

Key Idea:  
Resolve choices in grammar rules by looking at next symbol
of input
