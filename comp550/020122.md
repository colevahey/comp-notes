## Recurrence Methods Continued
**Substitution Method:**  
Make an educated guess  
Substitution cg(n) guess in  
T(n) actual value on left side equals  
cg(n) substituted right side equals  
Examine remainder to see if:  
RELATIVELY SMALL POSITIVE: BIG OMEGA(g(n))  
RELATIVELY SMALL NEGATIVE: BIG O(g(n))  
BOTH: THETA(g(n))  

For example, remainder is ```cn + 4``` then T(n) is BIG
OMEGA(guess)  

**Changing Variables:**  
Use algebraic manipuulation to make recurrence familiar  
Make something apparently unknown familiar  
Consider ```T(n) = 2T(sqrt(n)) + log2(n)```  
Note log2(n) and sqrt(n) are linear on log2(n) scale  
log2(n) = 1log2(n)  
log2(sqrt(n)) = 1/2log2(n)  
*Consider changing log2(n) = m, n = 2^m  
Rewrite ```T(n) = T(2^m) = 2T(2^(m/2)) + m``` where n = 2^m  

Need to do a second step!  
```S(m) = T(2^m) = 2S(m/2) + m```  
S(m) = Theta(mlog2(m))  
n = 2^m, log2(n) = m, S(m) = T(n)  

Substitute Back!! CHANGE THE Ms BACK TO Ns  
T(n) = Theta(log2(n)log2(log2(n)))
