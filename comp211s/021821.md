### Quiz 3 - Wed 2/24
Pollev Questions on Tuesday prior
### Lab 02 Due 2/20
Already done :)
### Lab 03 Posted 2/20
Late at night
### FIRST EXAM
**Friday 3/5**  
Open all day (1:00am - 11:55pm)  
Material Covered:  
- Foundation Knowledge (representing info)
- Software Part I: Programming concepts  
*10 - 12 questions* on Sakai  

## Pointers Continued
`int i;` New int i  
`int *p;` New pointer p  
`p = &i;` p equals `address of` i  
`*p = 5;` dereferenced p equals 5  
**SO i = 5 now**  

**Pass-by-Reference** - Pass memory address of argument to
the function (THINK POINTER)  
```C
int x, y, z;
scanf("%d%d%d", &x, &y, &z);
```
The `scanf` function takes the memory address arguments

**Pass-by-Value** - Pass *copy* of variable to argument of
function  
```C
int x = 2;
double_it(x);
```
The `double_it` function takes a copy of `x` at a new
address in memory  

WHY pass-by-reference:  
```C
void double(int *x) {
  *x = (*x) * 2;
}

int main() {
  int x = 10;
  double(&x);
  printf("%d\n", x); // 20
}
```

INSTEAD of pass-by-value:  
```C
void double(int x) {
  x = x * 2;
}

int main() {
  int x = 10;
  double(x);
  printf("%d\n", x); // 10
}
```

### Strings in C
There is no string class in C!!  
Only low-level support for strings as character arrays  
`char s[]` Array of characters  
`char *s` Pointer to the beginning of a string  
**But a rich library of string processing functions
(string.h)**  

**ALL** C functions assume string terminates with a NULL  
NULL = ASCII 0 character (`\0`)
SO: "hello" has length 6 as a char array  
`char a[] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};`  
OR:  
`char a[] = "hello"; // Compiler can recognize`  
`char a[5][6]` is an array of 5 char arrays of len(6)

### Interface vs. Implementation
Basic software design - Promote code reuse, use **existing**
software  
Your software includes Interface (header [.h] file) and  
Implementation:  
- Binary c file or
- Static or dynamic library  
In C, the compiler needs your interface that defines all the
function prototypes  
This is the header (.h) file!  
The header file also defines user defined constants and data
types  
```C
#include <stdio.h> // Prototype from C path
#include "sort.h" // Prototype from relative path
```

### Library Implementation
In C, the linker needs the implementation for each prototype
in the header file  
Binary file:  
- static (.a file)
- dynamic (.so file)  
Binary assembled file  
- machine language (.o file)
- Not very common but this is what is in lab 03  
Libraries in the std language (stdio, stdlib) are
**automatically** added at the linking stage by the linker  
Libraries not in the std language (math, etc) need to be
told to the linker to add at the linking stage using the -l
option  
**Dynamic linking** links the library at runtime  
- File size of the executable is small
- More efficient with memory
- Newer versions of libraries are always used  
**Static linking** links the library at compile-time  
- Faster
- One program in memory
