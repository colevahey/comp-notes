## Announcements
### Lab07 due Tuesday

## Process Scheduling
Creation -> Ready to run queue -> CPU Running -> Blocked
Queue (I/O) -> Ready to run Queue -> CPU -> Termination!  

**Preemptive Scheduling:** Setting a timer to interrupt the
CPU after some time  
**Non-preemptive scheduling:** Processes must explicitly
yield to the CPU  

### Context Switching
Called a *context switch* because the OS saves one execution
context and changes to another

Save the context of the CPU -> Update the process control
block of the process currently in the Running state -> Move
the process control block of this process to the appropriate
queue -> Select another process for execution -> Update the
process control block of the process selected -> Update
memory management data structures -> Restore the context of
the CPU to that which existed at the time the selected
process was last switched out
