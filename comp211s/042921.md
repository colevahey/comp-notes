### Orphan Processes
An **orphan** is a child process without a parent  
The parent terminates while the child continues running  

In theory, the orphan can be assigned to ANY of its parents'
parents  
Like grandparent, great grandparent, etc.  

However, it is easier to just assign the orphan to PID 1,
the system  

### Shortest Process Next (SPN)
Non-preemptive policy in which the process with the shortest
expected processing time is selected next  
A short process will jump to the head of the queue  

## Process Scheduling Algorithms
**Turnaround Time:** The interval of time between the
submission of a process and its completion. Includes actual
execution plus time spent waiting for resources, including
the processor. This is an appropriate measure for a batch
job  

**Response Time:** For an *interactive process*, this is the
time from the submission of a request until the response
begins to be received. Often a process can begin producing
some output to the user while continuing to process the
request  

**Throughput:** The scheduling policy should attempt to
maximize the number of processes completed per unit of time  

**Processor Utilization:** This is the percentage of time
that the processor (CPU) is busy  

**Fairness:** In the absence of guidance from the user or
other system-supplied guidance, processes should be treated
the same, and no process should suffer starvation

**Enforcing Priorities:** When processes are assigned
priorities, the scheduling policy should favor higher priority processes  

### First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Also known as FIFO queuing scheme  

### Round Robin
Uses preemption based on a clock  
Also known as **time slicing** because each process is given
a slice of time before being preempted  
Design issue is the length of the time slice to be used  
If A,B,C are on the CPU, A gets a slice, then B gets
a slice, then C gets a slice, then A again until they all
complete  

### Quick Reminder
**Preemptive Scheduling:** Setting a timer to interrupt the
CPU after some time  
**Non-preemptive Scheduling:** Processes must explicitly
yield the CPU
