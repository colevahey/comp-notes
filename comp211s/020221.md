#### Announcements
##### Quiz 1 this Friday
**Announcement on Sakai**
Beginning of Thursday's lecture poll-ev practice for the
quiz
##### Lab 01 Assigned Today
Read the instructions carefully  
Due next week
##### Updated Course Schedule
Lots of links in there  
Topics and everything being updated on a weekly basis  
Make sure to look at the schedule for readings etc  

#### Fixed Point Values
1101.0110(2C)  
0010.1010(Inverted)  
0 + 0 + 2^1 + 0 + 2^(-1) + 0 + 2^(-3) = 2.625  
1101.0110(2C) = -2.625(10)  
0010.1010(2C) = 2.625(10)  

#### Floating-Point Representation
Single Precision => 32-bits:  
- 1 for sign  
- 8 for exponent  
- 23 for fraction  
Better than fixed point because no longer a *magical* fixed
decimal point

***V = -1^(s) x 1.f x 2^(e - 127)***

12.75(10) to floating-point  
s = 0 (because positive)  

12.75(10) = 1100.11(fixed)  
1100.11(fixed) = 1.10011 x 2^3  

f = 10011  
e = 127+3 = 130(10) = 10000010(2)  

```
            s    e                f
12.75(10) = 0 10000010 10011000000000000000000
(single-precision floating-point)
```


-0.0625(10) to floating-point  
s = 1 (because negative, now ignore negative)  

0.0625(10) = 0000.0001 (fixed)  
0000.0001(fixed) = 1.0 x 2^(-4)  

f = 0  
e = 127-4 = 123(10) = 01111011(2)  

```
              s    e               f
-0.0625(10) = 1 01111011 00000000000000000000000
```

#### Double precision floating-point
64-bits!  
- 1 bit for sign  
- 11 bits for exponent  
- 52 bits for fraction  
- *2047 bias for exponent*  
- Works the same way as single-precision  

#### Arithmetic
Multiplying and dividing by 2:  
1 * 2 = 2  
0001(2) * 2(10) = 0010  

4 / 2 = 2  
0100(2) / 2(10) = 0010  

**Shift Left Logical (sll)**
Shift to the left by one bit (x2(10)) and add a 0 to the end

**Shift Right Logical (srl)**
Shift to the right by one bit (/2(10)) and add a 0 to the
front

**Shift Right Arithmetic/Signed**
Shift to the right by one bit but add the correct signed bit
to the front

## Programming Concepts
Reading assignment in course schedule  
Assembly instruction set tells the computer what to do  
- Intel instruction set, ARM instruction set  
Generally go from high-level language to assembly  
**Assembler**
- Takes assembly instructions and converts it to machine
  code

C -> Assembly -> Object Program -> Executable Program  
 Compiler   Assembler          Linker  
**gcc does all of these things**
