#### Look at min and max calculations on the slides

## Language Abstraction
#### Execution Model
High level  
Assembly  
Machine  
**Static Library (.a (archive))** - Combined with program to
make one executable at the end  
**Dynamic Library (.so (shared object))** - Linked library,
not a part of the executable at the end, grabbed at runtime  

High Level - pi.c  
Assembly - pi.s  
Machine (ELF binary) - pi.o  
LINKING - a.out  

*Instructions* - The words of a  computer's language  
*Instruction Set (IS)* - The full vocabulary for a CPU
architecture  
*MIPS CPU architecture* - Microprocessor without Interlocked
Pipelined Stages  
- Reduced instruction set computer (RISC)
- MIPS cheat-sheet on Sakai

### MIPS
r, i, j  
r - Basic arithmetic and logic  
i - Memory instructions  
j - Jumps!  
Everything is very very simple  
There aren't loops or conditionals  
Everything is reduced to simple instructions  
There's only like 40 of them total!  
In MIPS architecture there are 32 general purpose
registers  
Instructions are *primitive* operations  
- They specify an operation and its operands
- `add $t0, $t1, $t2`  
From registers $t0 = $t1 + $t2

Let's do an example, acting like the compiler   
#### C:
```C
int a = 10;
int b = 2;
int c = a + b + 2;
```

#### MIPS:
```
addi $t0, $0, 10 // t0 = 0 + 10
addi $t1, $0, 2 // t1 = 0 + 2
addi $t2, $t0, $t1 // t2 = t0 + t1
addi $t3, $t2, 2 // t3 = t2 + 2
```  
**$t0** is a  
**$t1** is b  
**$t3** is c  

#### Machine Code:
   op code   rs (source)   rt (target)     rt (median)
``` 001000      00000         01000     00000000 00001010```
