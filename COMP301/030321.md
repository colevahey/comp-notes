## Modern Error Handling
**Exception Handling**  
A formal method for detecting, signaling, and responding to
errors  
Built in to the programming language  
Supported by Java, C++, C#, Python, JS, Ruby, etc.  

**Two parts:**  
Throwing an exception (*detection*)  
Catching an exception (*handling*)  

**Benefits of Exceptions:**  
Consistent, extensible, modular  
Expressive - Can express exactly what type of error occurred
and can encapsulate details about the error  
Dependable, obvious behavior - If an error occurs, the
programmer will know about it and the programmer can decide
whether to handle the error  
Safe - Can designate critical code to execute no matter
what, even if an error occurs  

**Exceptions are Objects**  
Exception objects use encapsulation to store details about
the specific error that occurred  
Exception objects use inheritance to classify what kind of
error occurred  

**Throwing an exception**  
```Java
private void setAge(int age) {
  if (age < 0) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("AGE IS NOT
    ALLOWED");
  }
  this.age = age;
}
```

**Catching an exception**  
```Java
try {
  methodA();
  methodB();
  methodC();
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
  // code to respond to ExceptionType
} catch (OtherExceptionType oe) {
  // code to respond to OtherExceptionType
}
```
If an exception is not caught, it is an *uncaught exception*
which will terminate the program  
If an exception is caught, then the catch program will run
and then the program will continue past the try/catch  

**Be careful about is-a relationships**  
If an ArithmeticException is thrown, then
a RuntimeException will catch because ArithmeticException
IS-A RuntimeException  

**Finally Block:**  
```Java
try {
  // try code
} catch (RuntimeException e) {
  // catch code
} finally {
  // final code, GUARANTEED TO RUN even if an error occurs
}
```
