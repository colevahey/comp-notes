## Announcements
### Nice work on a09
### Final Exam
Open on Gradescope for 24 hours on Monday  
3 Hour Limit  
Open IDE, Notes  
Cumulative, about two quizzes worth of questions  
### Consider being an LA for 301 (?)

## Concurrency
**Sequential Computing:** When a series of computations are
executed *one at a time*, such that each computation must
**finish** before the next can begin  

**Concurrent Computing:** When a series of computations are
executed *during overlapping time periods*  

**Synchronous Programming:** A model of programming where
a task may be started, and the program *waits for it to
complete* before continuing on (sequential)  

**Asynchronous Programming:** A model of programming where
a task may be started, but the program *continues on without
waiting* for it to complete  

**Thread:** An abstraction for *executing a program*  
To execute any program, your operating system creates
a thread  

A *thread* encapsulates the following information:  
**Instruction Pointer:** The current point of execution  
**Call Stack:** Which methods are currently executing  
**Memory:** The contents of memory, including the heap  

A single program can run *multiple threads at the same time*  
Separate **instruction pointer**  
Separate **call stack**  
**SHARED MEMORY**  

### Java Runnable Interface  
The `Runnable` interface is built-in to Java  
A `Runnable` object represents a task that can be
performed  

**Synchronous Use of Runnable:**  
```Java
public class MultiThreader {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Runnable task1 = 
      () -> {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          System.out.println(i);
        }
      };

    System.out.println("Printing 0-9");

    task1.run();

    System.out.println("Done");
  }
}
```

The `Thread` class is built-in to Java  
A `Thread` class represents a thread of execution  
A `Thread` must be given a `Runnable` object to
execute in the constructor  
Also has a `start()` method for running the executable  
Executes the `Runnable` *asynchronously* (in parallel)  

**Asynchronous Use of Runnable:**  
```Java
public class MultiThreader {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Runnable task1 = 
      () -> {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          System.out.println(i);
        }
      };

    System.out.println("Printing 0-9");

    Thread thread = new Thread(task1);
    thread.start();

    System.out.println("Done");
  }
}
```
