## JavaFX Structure
```Java
public class App extends Application {
  @Override
  pubic void start(Stage stage) {
    // ...
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Call launch to launch the application
    Launch();
  }
}
```

**Stage** represents the window itself, displays one *scene*
at a time  
The current *scene* can be swapped out to change the
application's layout/view  

**Scene** object represents the complete contents of the
window  
Acts as a container for all the displayed content  
An application can have multiple scenes, but only one can be
displayed per stage at a time  

```Java
@Override
public void start(Stage stage) {
  Scene scene = new Scene(root, 300, 250);
  scene.setRoot(Parent value);
  //...
}
```

JafaFX Scene Graph:  
```
        Application
        Stage
        Scene
        Pane
TextField       Pane
           Button   Label
```

The root of the Scene graph is the Scene object!  
The tree represents the UI components that are currently
being shown to the user  

There's only ONE STAGE but there can be multiple scenes  

**JavaFX Layout Panes:**  
BorderPane - Five regions where children can be positioned  
HBox - Children are positioned horizontally  
VBox - Children are positioned vertically  
StackPane - Children are positioned directly over each other  
GridPane - Children are positioned in a grid  
FlowPane - Children are positioned left-to-right
(top-to-bottom) and wrap to the next row (or column) when
the edge is reached  
TilePane - Children are positioned just like `FlowPane`, but
every child is forced to be the same dimension  
AnchorPane - Children are anchored to an edge of the window
(top, bottom, left, right, or center)  

### SEE 2048 SCENE GRAPH!!!

**Extremely common GUI programming pattern:**  
Separate content code from style code  

**Content code:** Defines what gets displayed  
**Style code:** Defines how to display it (colors, size,
etc.)  

Content code goes in `/src/main/java/...`  
Style code goes in `/src/main/resources/style/...`  
Contains CSS code  

```Java
Label instructions = new Label("This is a label!");

// Define class
instructions.getStyleClass().add("instructionsClass");

layout.getChildren().add(instructions);

Scene scene = new Scene(layout, 350, 450);

// Add stylesheet to the scene
scene.getStyleshets().add("style/main.css");

stage.setScene(scene);
```
