## MODULE 3: Design Patterns
#### What are design patterns?
Design patterns are *general strategies* for approaching
common situations that arise when writing code  

## Iterator Design Pattern
> "Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate
> object sequentially without exposing its underlying
> representation"  

#### Collection
A group of zero or more similar objects  
Data structures are used to organize collections  

**Examples:**  
Binary Tree  
Linked List  
Array  
Hash Map  

A common operation between all of these collections is to
iterate through the items within them  
However, this iteration looks **different** for each
structure  

### Iterator\<T\> Interface
#### Iterator's Big Idea
For a given collection, create a class that encapsulates the
details of how to loop through it  

The iterator pattern is so well-known that Java and most
other programming languages offer built-in language support
for the iterator design pattern  

**Two built-in interfaces:**  
`Iterator<T>`  
`Iterable<T>`  

**Java Iterator<T> Interface**  
```Java
public interface Iterator<T> {

  boolean hasNext();
  
  T next();

  // DONT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THESE
  default void forEachRemaining(Consumer<? super T> action)
  {};
  default void remove() {};
}
```

#### Implementing an Iterator
```Java
String[] data = new String[]{"a", "b", "c"};

Iterator<String> iterator = new IteratorImpl(data);

while (iterator.hasNext()) {
  String str = iterator.next();
  System.out.println(str);
}
```

**Facts about using iterators:**  
`next()` throws a `NoSuchElementException` after all
elements in the collection are seen  
The iterator pattern usually assumes that the collection
will not be modified while the iterator is active  

### Designing an Iterator Class
#### What needs to be encapsulated in an iterator object?  
The iterator object tracks progress through the collection  
Knows which items have been seen, and which are coming up
next  
Manages order of items, but does not modify the underlying
collection  

At the bare minimum, the iterator object must have:  
Access to the collection  
A way to track which items have been seen  

#### Iterator Design Strategy 1
1. Encapsulate the raw collection
2. Add a "cursor" field to track progress through the
   collection (like an index for an array)
3. Each time `next()` is called, update the cursor field  

```Java
public class IteratorImpl implements Iterator<String> {
  private String[] collection;
  private int cursor;

  public IteratorImpl(String[] collection) {
    this.collection = collection;
    this.cursor = 0;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean hasNext() {
    return cursor < collection.length;
  }

  @Override
  public String next() {
    if (hasNext()) {
      String item = collection[cursor];
      cursor++;
      return item;
    } else {
      throw new NoSuchElementException();
    }
  }
}
```

##### Advantages of this strategy
Memory-efficient and fast  
##### Disadvantages of this strategy
Hard to change the order of the items  
Undefined behavior if the collection is modified externally  

#### Iterator Design Strategy 2
1. Encapsulate a *clone* of the raw collection  
2. Sort or manipulate the cloned collection to make iteration
easier  
3. Add a "cursor" field to track progress through the cloned
collection  
4. Each time `next()` is called, update the cursor field  

```Java
public class IteratorImpl implements Iterator<String> {
  private String[] collection;
  private int cursor;

  public IteratorImpl(String[] collection) {

    // ONLY DIFFERENCE FROM STRATEGY 1
    this.collection = collection.clone();
    Arrays.sort(this.collection);

    this.cursor = 0;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean hasNext() {
    return cursor < collection.length;
  }

  @Override
  public String next() {
    if (hasNext()) {
      String item = collection[cursor];
      cursor++;
      return item;
    } else {
      throw new NoSuchElementException();
    }
  }
}
```

##### Advantages of this strategy
Changing the order of items in the cloned collection does
not affect the original (external) collection  
Changing the order (or number) of items in the original
collection does not affect the iterator  
Convenient for iterators that sort the collection
##### Disadvantages of this strategy
Memory-inefficient (requires a full copy of the collection)  
Cannot work for infinite collection  

#### Iterator Design Strategy 3
1. Encapsulate *another iterator* for the raw collection  
2. Each time `next()` or `hasNext()` is called, use the
   other iterator's `next()` and `hasNext()` methods  

##### Advantages of this strategy
Relies on the iterator object to do the "hard work"  
##### Disadvantages of this strategy
Can be tricky to implement  
Requires an iterator to already exist for the collection
