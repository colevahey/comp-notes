# Tools of COMP 301

**Maven**
- Java Build Automation Tool

**Announcements**
- Homework: Complete honor code agreement
  - *Due Wednesday 1/27*
  - **ALREADY DONE :)**

### Question: What happens when you RUN a program?
**Packaging application code into a final, *distributable*
product is a crucial part of software development**
- Code is only useful *if it is being used*
- Programming languages have different approaches to
  packaging and distribution
  - We are going to be learning about Java's build process

##### Running Java is a two-step process
1. Compile the source code into bytecode
2. Execute the binary

**Compilation**
The process of translating a program from source code into
a language that a machine can more easily understand
- i.e. bytecode (00 00 00 01 10 2A 39...)

**Execution**
The process of feeding a compiled program into a machine
that can follow the instructions
- *Source code is not necessary to execute bytecode*

#### Compiling and executing large projects
**Large projects commonly have:**
1. Hundreds of .java source files to compile
2. External *dependencies* that must be imported

*Dependency* - "Third-party" library containing code that you didn't write yourself, but is used in your project
- Two dependencies for us will be JUnit and JavaFX

**.jar files are compiled dependencies**
**.class files are compiled source code**
**You need both to execute a program**

#### Packaging a compiled program
- .jar file
- bytecode and dependencies are all combined so you have
  a more distributable format
- .jar file can be run on a Java virtual machine all by
  itself 

**Compiling on the command line**

`javac -classpath dependencyPath1;dependencyPath2 sourceFile`

**Executing on the command line**

`java -classpath dependencyPath1;dependencyPath2
classFileToBeExecuted`

#### Java Packages and Imports
*Not the same as "packaging" your code in a .jar file*

`package com.comp301.lec01.ex01;`
- Defines the package that the class lives in
- Packages are for organizing class files into different
  "units"
- Put *related* class files in the *same* package
- Put *unrelated* class files in *different* packages
- Don't be afraid to make new packages!!
  - You are in control of your project's organizational
    scheme
- Packages can be nested!!
  - `package earth.world;`
  - **earth** is in the **world** package

**Packages are associated with subfolders in the source
directory**
- Each package is a subfolder
- Class files are placed in the folder associated with their
  package
  - This **forces** the source directory to be organized
    into subfolders
  - Packages define folder structure
  - `package earth.world` with `class Hello` inside has the
    path earth/world/Hello.java

**Importing across packages**
- Use the full path for the other class

#### Build Process
**Build process tasks vary from project to project and from
language to language** 
1. Clean - Delete leftover files
2. Compile - Compile into bytecode
3. Test - Run unit tests for the project
4. Package - Pack into a distributable format
5. Verify - Make sure your package quality is up to par 
6. Site - Provide documentation for your work
7. Deploy - Send out your project

**Maven is a java build automation tool that we will be
using**
