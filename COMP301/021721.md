## Polymorphism Review
**Polymorphism** - Using the same name for multiple things  
TODAY: Method overriding and overloading  

### Overriding Methods
```Java
Person aaron = new Student("Aaron");

System.out.println(aaron.getName());
```
What if we want to print out "Professor Aaron" instead of
just his name?  
```Java
@Override
public String getName() {
  return "Professor " + name;
}
```
`@Override` is a "compiler directive" and is optional but
helps for readability in code  
This method may or not work, because `name` might be private
in the parent class  
Either change the access modifier to `protected` OR  
Use the getter method of the parent `super.getName()`  

```Java
public class Pet {
  public String noise() {
    return "yowp";
  }
}

public class Dog extends Pet {
  @Override
  public String noise() {
    return "woof";
  }
}

// Program to the interface
// On the heap a Dog object encapsulating a Pet instance
Pet fido = new Dog();

// Create a new reference to the Dog instance
// Can access fields of Dog
Dog fidoAsDog = (Dog) fido;

// ONLY IF NOISE IS A "VIRTUAL METHOD"
// Virtual methods can recognize that the overridden method
// exists (in Java ALL methods are virtual)
// Always execute the subclass version
System.out.println(fido.noise());       // woof
System.out.println(fidoAsDog.noise());  // woof

// IF NOISE IS NOT A VIRTUAL METHOD (doesn't happen in Java)
System.out.println(fido.noise());       // yowp
System.out.println(fidoAsDog.noise());  // woof
```

#### The Final Keyword
`final` - Indicates that an entity is immutable  
Declaring a method with the `final` keyword means it can
**never** be overridden  
Declaring a class as `final` means that it can have no
subclasses  
When added to a field or variable, `final` indicates that
its value cannot change after instantiation  

### Overloading Methods
**Overloading** To define more than one constructor or
method in a class *with the same name*  
Overloaded methods **MUST** have different parameter lists  
Either differences in number or in data type  
They must have the same *access modifier*  
They also must have the same *static/non-static* status  
Commonly used for constructors  
**Chaining** constructors uses constructors to call one
another  
```Java
public Professor(String name) {
  // This is the chain call
  this(name, 0);
}

public Professor(String name, int status) {
  ...
}
```
