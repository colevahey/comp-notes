## Decorator Pattern Continued
### Unwrapping Decorators
Decorating an object creates a *new object*  
The original object gets **encapsulated inside**  

Most decorators will have an `unwrap()` method  
```Java
public PriceTag unwrap() {
  return tag;
}

...

PriceTag discountRemoval = ((DiscountedPriceTag) discountTag).unwrap();
```

### Limitations of Decorator Pattern
**Linked list must be managed by programmer**  
Does order matter?  
Are some decorations incompatible with each other?  
What if the same decoration is added multiple times?  

No access to encapsulated object's protected fields
