Study guide released this weekend  
After hours study session next Monday or Tuesday  

## Exceptions Continued
### Finally Block
```Java
try {
  System.out.println("A");
  method1();
  System.out.println("B");
} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
  System.out.println("C");
} finally {
  System.out.println("D");
}

public void method1() {
  throw new RuntimeException();
}
```
Prints "AD"

```Java
try {
  return;
} catch () {
  System.out.println("A");
} finally {
  System.out.println("B");
}
System.out.println("C");
```
PRINTS "B"  
**Finally always runs**  
EVEN IF THERE IS AN UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION  

### Creating Exception Classes
`public class NotValid extends RuntimeException() {}`  
Now you can throw a NotValid exception just like any other
RuntimeException  

### Summary
Use `throw` to throw an exception object  
Use `try/catch` to find exceptions  
Use `finally` to run code after the `try/catch`  

## Caught Exceptions
### Throwable Superclass
Throwable is the parent of Error (external problems that the programmer cannot handle) and Exception which is the parent of RuntimeException  
However, all RuntimeExceptions are considered unchecked  
IOExceptions, ClassNotFound, CloneNotSupported are checked!  

### Unchecked Exceptions
Represent situations that are usually caused by internal
factors  
Might be handled by your program  

### Checked Exceptions
Represent situations that may occur even during "normal"
conditions  
Are usually caused by *external* factors  
Don't necessarily indicate a bug  

JAVA rules: Whenever you have a method or function that may
throw a checked exception, the running method must either
**Catch** the exception or **Specify** that it might also
throw a checked exception  

**Catch** - Try/catch block that catches the checked
exception  
**Specify** - Add declaration to the method declaration  
`public Scanner open(String file) throws
FileNotFoundException {}`  

Checked exceptions MUST obey the "catch or specify" rule  
If a method contains code that *might* throw a checked
exception, then the method must either:  
**Catch** the exception OR  
**Specify** that it might throw the exception  

WHY?  
**Defensive programming** - Force the programmer to address
the situation  
Situations represented by a checked exception should
probably be handled  

## Exception Best Practices
1. Throw exceptions early  
  - Throw an exception as soon as you detect a wrong value  
  - This is defensive programming  
2. Be specific when throwing an exception  
  - Try to use a built-in exception type  
  - But don't be afraid to make your own to describe
    a situation  
3. Catch exceptions late  
  - Just because you can catch an exception doesn't mean you
    should  
  - Don't catch an exception unless you know how to deal
    with the situation  

## Nested Try Catch
Exceptions can be passed up the call stack from inside try
catch blocks  
Works the same way as a single try/catch
