## Classic MVC
**Model:**  
Application state in *private fields*  
Getter methods to expose the state  
Modifier methods to change the state  
Notify observers when state changes  

**Controller:**  
Handles user events with *public methods*  
Controls model in *response to events*  

**View:**  
Renders UI  
Displays UI  
Forwards UI events *to controller*  
Refreshes UI upon state change  

View calls controller methods to handle user interactions  
Controller calls model setter methods in response to user
interaction  
View calls model methods to generate the UI  
Model observes the view to gather state changes  

```Java
// CLASSIC MVC SETUP
Model model = new Model();

Controller controller = new Controller(model);

View view = new View(controller, model);
model.addObserver(view);
```

## Alternate MVC
Controller intermediates between the View and Model  
Model notifies controller when application state changes  
Controller notifies View when application state changes  
View calls Controller methods which call Model methods  

```Java
// ALTERNATE MVC SETUP
// DECOUPLE THE MODEL AND VIEW THROUGH THE CONTROLLER  
Model model = new Model();

Controller controller = new Controller(model);
model.addObserver(controller);

View view = new View(controller);
controller.addObserver(view);
```

### How to Design a UI
1. Wireframes - Mock up the UI on paper or with the help of
   a tool like Adobe XD  
2. Model - Decide what state needs to be stored in the model
   and write a model class  
3. View - Turn the pictures into code with the help of
   a library like JavaFX  
4. Controller - Write the code that responds to human
   interactions  

```Java

// VIEW DESIGN

public class View implements FXComponent {
  private final Cotnroller controller;
  
  public View(Controller controller) {
    this.controller = controller;
  }

  @Override
  public Parent render() {
    VBox layout = new VBox();

    // Controls View
    ControlsViewcontrolsView = new ControlsView(controller);
    layout.getChildren().add(controlsView.render());

    // AddSong view
    AddSongView addSongView = new AddSongView(controller);
    layout.getChildren().add(addSongView.render());

    return layout;
  }
}
```
