## Inheritance (*Continued*)
### Subclasses in Memory
What happens in memory when the subclass constructor is
called?  
`new Sub("name");` Add space for Sub on heap  
`public Sub(String name) {super(name);}` Call constructor  
`public SuperConst(String name) {_name = name;}` Create
Superclass instance inside of the subclass instance  
`_name = name;` go set the String reference \_name to the
value of name  

## Polymorphism
The principle of reusing one common name or symbol to refer
to multiple different related entities  

#### Basic Polymorphism
**Use the superclass for intialization**  
```java
Superclass s = new Subclass("name");
```
Use `sub instanceof super` conditional operator to check
for instance true or false  
*instanceof* returns true for the type and its parents  
**Type casting** - Casting an instance to a type (*not
always safe*)  
**Downcasting** - Superclass being cast *down* to the
subclass  
**Upcasting** - Subclass being cast *up* to the superclass  
- Upcasting is **always** safe!!

**Method Access** - References to objects in memory have
access *only* to the methods defined for their **declared**
type  
```java
// pat declared as Person, so no access to Student methods
Person pat = new Student("Pat");

// DOWNCAST pat to a Student and now access Student methods
Student patS = (Student) pat;
```

#### Parametric Polymorphism  
Using *generics(<T>)* so a field or variable can take on
different data types  
```java
String func(Item<T> i) {}
```

#### Overriding and Overloading Methods
Using methods that have the same name but take different
arguments (OVERLOAD) or are different in a subclass
(OVERRIDE)  

#### Multiple Constructors
Constructor overloading (constructors with different
arguments)
