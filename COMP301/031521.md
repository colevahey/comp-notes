TWO STUDY GUIDES ON SAKAI

## Professional Software Testing
1. Unit Testing  
2. Integration Testing  
3. System Testing  
4. Acceptance Testing  

**Unit Testing**  
Test methods and classes in ***isolation***  
Occurs during development  

**Integration Testing**  
Test how new code integrates with ***existing modules***  
Occurs during development

**System Testing**  
Test the ***entire system*** as a whole  
Occurs after development  

**Acceptance Testing**  
Test in a ***production-like environment***  
Occurs before release  

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**The FIRST thing you do is write tests, even before you
start designing your code**  
1. Define the software requirements  
2. Write unit tests according to the requirements  
3. Write code to make the unit tests pass  
### JUnit
**JUnit:** A *library* for helping you write unit tests  
Extremely well-known in the Java world  

JUnit provides:  
**assertion methods**  
The `@Test` annotation  
The ability to *automate testing*  
And more...  

Add JUnit as a **dependency** in Maven `POM` file  

### Unit Testing Structure
```Java
// Class to perform tests on
public class InventoryTest {

  // First unit test
  @Test
  public void testConstructor() {

  }

  // Second unit test
  @Test
  public void testAddItem() {

  }
}
```  

### Writing Unit Tests
```Java
@Test
public void testConstructor() {
  new Cat("Jimmy");
}
```  
If there is no uncaught exception, the test passes  
If there is an uncaught exception, the test will fail!  

**Typical JUnit Unit Test:**  
1. Create an object  
2. Call some methods to change the state of the object  
3. Use assertions to verify the state of the object  

```Java
@Test
public void testName() {
  Animal c = new Cat("Jimmy");
  c.rename("Donald");

  // assertTrue(c.getName().equals("Donald"));
  // THIS ONE IS BETTER 
  assertEquals("Donald", c.getName());
}
```
